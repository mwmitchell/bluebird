<head>CHAPTER I<lb/><lb/>
FED UP</head>

<p>So this is what happened to the dozen-odd
malcontents who could no longer stand the
dirty business in Europe and the dirtier politicians
at home.</p>

<p>There was treachery in the Senate, treason
in the House. A plague of liars infested the
Republic; the land was rotting with plots.</p>

<p>But if the authorities at Washington remained
incredulous, stunned into impotency,
while the din of murder filled the world, a few
mere men, fed up on the mess, sickened while
awaiting executive galvanization, and started
east to purge their souls.</p>

<p>They came from the four quarters of the continent,
drawn to the decks of the mule transport
by a common sickness and a common necessity.
Only two among them had ever before<pb n='2'/><anchor id='Pg2'/>

met. They represented all sorts, classes, degrees
of education and of ignorance, drawn to
a common rendezvous by coincidental nausea
incident to the temporary stupidity and poltroonery
of those supposed to represent them
in the Congress of the Great Republic.</p>

<p>The rendezvous was a mule transport reeking
with its cargo, still tied up to the sun-scorched
wharf where scores of loungers loafed
and gazed up at the rail and exchanged badinage
with the supercargo.</p>

<p>The supercargo consisted of this dozen-odd
fed-up ones&mdash;eight Americans, three Frenchmen
and one Belgian.</p>

<p>There was a young soldier of fortune named
Carfax, recently discharged from the Pennsylvania
State Constabulary, who seemed to feel
rather sure of a commission in the British
service.</p>

<p>Beside him, leaning on the blistering rail,
stood a self-possessed young man named Harry
Stent. He had been educated abroad; his
means were ample; his time his own. He had
shot all kinds of big game except a Hun, he told
another young fellow&mdash;a civil engineer&mdash;who<pb n='3'/><anchor id='Pg3'/>

stood at his left and whose name was Jim
Brown.</p>

<p>A youth on crutches, passing along the deck
behind them, lingered, listening to the conversation,
slightly amused at Stent's game list and
his further ambition to bag a Boche.</p>

<p>The young man's lameness resulted from a
trench acquaintance with the game which Stent
desired to hunt. His regiment had been, and
still was, the 2nd Foreign Legion. He was on
his way back, now, to finish his convalescence
in his old home in Finist&egrave;re. He had been a
writer of stories for children. His name was
Jacques Wayland.</p>

<p>As he turned away from the group at the
rail, still amused, a man advancing aft spoke to
him by name, and he recognized an American
painter whom he had met in Brittany.</p>

<p>"You, Neeland?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I'm fed up with watchful waiting."</p>

<p>"Where are you bound, ultimately?"</p>

<p>"I've a hint that an Overseas unit can use
me. And you, Wayland?"</p>

<pb n='4'/><anchor id='Pg4'/>
<p>"Going to my old home in Finist&egrave;re where
I'll get well, I hope."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Second Foreign."</p>

<p>"Oh. Get that leg in the trenches?" inquired
Neeland.</p>

<p>"Yes. Came over to recuperate. But Finist&egrave;re
calls me. I've <hi rend='italic'>got</hi> to smell the sea off
Eryx before I can get well."</p>

<p>A pleasant-faced, middle-aged man, who
stood near, turned his head and cast a professionally
appraising glance at the young
fellow on crutches.</p>

<p>His name was Vail; he was a physician.
It did not seem to him that there was much
chance for the lame man's very rapid recovery.</p>

<p>Three muleteers came on deck from below&mdash;all
young men, all talking in loud, careless
voices. They wore uniforms of khaki resembling
the regular service uniform. They
had no right to these uniforms.</p>

<p>One of these young men had invented the
costume. His name was Jack Burley. His
two comrades were, respectively, "Sticky"<pb n='5'/><anchor id='Pg5'/>
Smith and "Kid" Glenn. Both had figured
in the squared circle. All three were fed
up. They desired to wallop something, even
if it were only a leather-rumped mule.</p>

<p>Four other men completed the supercargo&mdash;three
French youths who were returning
for military duty and one Belgian. They
had been waiters in New York. They also
were fed up with the administration. They
kept by themselves during the voyage. Nobody
ever learned their names. They left
the transport at Calais, reported, and were
lost to sight in the flood of young men flowing
toward the trenches.</p>

<p>They completed the odd dozen of fed-up
ones who sailed that day on the suffocating
mule transport in quest of something they
needed but could not find in America&mdash;something
that lay somewhere amid flaming obscurity
in that hell of murder beyond the
Somme&mdash;their souls' salvation perhaps.</p>

<p>Twelve fed-up men went. And what happened
to all except the four French youths
is known. Fate laid a guiding hand on the
shoulder of Carfax and gave him a gentle<pb n='6'/><anchor id='Pg6'/>
shove toward the Vosges. Destiny linked
arms with Stent and Brown and led them
toward Italy. Wayland's rendezvous with Old
Man Death was in Finist&egrave;re. Neeland sailed
with an army corps, but Chance met him at Lorient
and led him into the strangest paths a
young man ever travelled.</p>

<p>As for Sticky Smith, Kid Glenn and Jack
Burley, they were muleteers. Or thought
they were. A muleteer has to do with mules.
Nothing else is supposed to concern him.</p>

<p>But into the lives of these three muleteers
came things never dreamed of in their
philosophy&mdash;never imagined by them even in
their cups.</p>

<p>As for the others, Carfax, Brown, Stent,
Wayland, Neeland, this is what happened to
each one of them. But the episode of Carfax
comes first. It happened somewhere
north of the neutral Alpine region where the
Vosges shoulder their way between France
and Germany.</p>

<p>After he had exchanged a dozen words
with a staff officer, he began to realize,
vaguely, that he was done in.</p>
</div>

MAROONED</head>

<p>"Will they do anything for us?" repeated
Carfax.</p>

<p>The staff officer thought it very doubtful.
He stood in the snow switching his wet puttees
and looking out across a world of tumbled
mountains. Over on his right lay Germany;
on his left, France; Switzerland towered
in ice behind him against an arctic
blue sky.</p>

<p>It grew warm on the Falcon Peak, almost
hot in the sun. Snow was melting on black
heaps of rocks; a black salamander, swollen,
horrible, stirred from its stiff lethargy and
crawled away blindly across the snow.</p>

<p>"Our case is this," continued Carfax; "somebody's
made a mistake. We've been forgotten.
And if they don't relieve us rather soon<pb n='8'/><anchor id='Pg8'/>
some of us will go off our bally nuts. Do
you get me, Major?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you understand what I've been saying?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; quite so."</p>

<p>"Then ask yourself, Major, how long can
four men stand it, cooped up here on this
peak? A month, two months, three, five?
But it's going on ten months&mdash;ten months of
solitude&mdash;silence&mdash;not a sound, except when
the snowslides go bellowing off into Alsace
down there below our feet." His bronzed
lip quivered. "I'll get aboard one if this keeps
on."</p>

<p>He kicked a lump of ice off into space;
the staff officer glanced at him and looked
away hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Carfax with an effort; "we're
not regulars&mdash;not like the others. The Canadian
division is different. Its discipline
is different&mdash;in spite of Salisbury Plain and
K. of K. In my regiment there are half-breeds,
pelt-hunters, Nome miners, Yankees
of all degrees, British, Canadians, gentlemen<pb n='9'/><anchor id='Pg9'/>

adventurers from Cosmopolis. They're good
soldiers, but do you think they'd stay here?
It is so in the Athabasca Battalion; it is the
same in every battalion. They wouldn't stay
here ten months. They couldn't. We are
free people; we can't stand indefinite caging;
we've got to have walking room once every
few months."</p>

<p>The staff officer murmured something.</p>

<p>"I know; but good God, man! Four of
us have been on this peak for nearly ten
months. We've never seen a Boche, never
heard a shot. Seasons come and go, rain
falls, snow falls, the winds blow from the
Alps, but nothing else comes to us except a
half-frozen bird or two."</p>

<p>The staff officer looked about him with an
involuntary shiver. There was nothing to
see except the sun on the wet, black rocks
and the whitewashed observation station of
solid stone from which wires sagged into the
valley on the French side.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;good luck," he said hastily, looking
as embarrassed as he felt. "I'll be toddling
along."</p>

<pb n='10'/><anchor id='Pg10'/>

<p>"Will you say a word to the General, like
a good chap? Tell him how it is with us&mdash;four
of us all alone up here since the beginning.
There's Gary, Captain in the Athabasca
Battalion, a Yankee if the truth were
known; there's Flint, a cockney lieutenant in
a Calgary battery; there's young Gray, a
lieutenant and a Prince Edward Islander;
and here's me, a major in the Yukon Battalion&mdash;four
of us on the top of a cursed
French mountain&mdash;ten months of each other,
of solitude, silence&mdash;and the whole world
rocking with battles&mdash;and not a sound up
here&mdash;not a whisper! I tell you we're four
sick men! We've got a grip on ourselves
yet, but it's slipping. We're still fairly civil
to each other, but the strain is killing. Sullen
silences smother irritability, but&mdash;" he
added in a peculiarly pleasant voice, "I expect
we are likely to start killing each other
if somebody doesn't get us out of here very
damn quick."</p>

<p>The staff captain's lips formed the words,
"Awfully sorry! Good luck!" but his articu<pb n='11'/><anchor id='Pg11'/>lation
was indistinct, and he went off hurriedly,
still murmuring.</p>

<p>Carfax stood in the snow, watching him
clamber down among the rocks, where an
alpinist orderly joined them.</p>

<p>Gary presently appeared at the door of
the observation station. "Has he gone?" he
inquired, without interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carfax.</p>

<p>"Is he going to do anything for us?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.... <hi rend='italic'>No!</hi>"</p>

<p>Gary lingered, kicked at a salamander,
then turned and went indoors. Carfax sat
down on a rock and sucked at his empty
pipe.</p>

<p>Later the three officers in the observation
station came out to the door again and
looked at him, but turned back into the doorway
without saying anything. And after a
while Carfax, feeling slightly feverish, went
indoors, too.</p>

<p>In the square, whitewashed room Gray and
Flint were playing cut-throat poker; Gary
was at the telephone, but the messages received
or transmitted appeared to be of no<pb n='12'/><anchor id='Pg12'/>
importance. There had never been any message
of importance from the Falcon Peak or
to it. There was likely to be none.</p>

<p>Ennui, inertia, dry rot&mdash;and four men,
sometimes silently, sometimes violently cursing
their isolation, but always cursing it&mdash;afraid
in their souls lest they fall to cursing
one another aloud as they had begun to curse
in their hearts.</p>

<p>Months ago rain had fallen; now snow
fell, and vast winds roared around them from
the Alps. But nothing else ever came to the
Falcon Peak, except a fierce, red-eyed <hi rend='italic'>L&auml;mmergeyer</hi>

sheering above the peak on enormous
pinions, or a few little migrating birds
fluttering down, half frozen, from the high
air lanes. Now and then, also, came to
them a staff officer from below, British sometimes,
sometimes French, who lingered no
longer than necessary and then went back
again, down into friendly deeps where were
trees and fields and familiar things and human
companionship, leaving them to their
hell of silence, of solitude, and of each other.</p>

<p>The tide of war had never washed the base<pb n='13'/><anchor id='Pg13'/>
of their granite cliffs; the highest battle wave
had thundered against the Vosges beyond
earshot; not even a deadened echo of war
penetrated those silent heights; not a Taube
floated in the zenith.</p>

<p>In the squatty, whitewashed ruin which once
had been the eyrie of some petty predatory
despot, and which now served as an observatory
for two idle divisions below in the valley,
stood three telescopes. Otherwise the
furniture consisted of valises, trunks, a table
and chairs, a few books, several newspapers,
and some tennis balls lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Carfax seated himself at one of the telescopes,
not looking through it, his heavy eyes
partly closed, his burnt-out pipe between his
teeth.</p>

<p>Gary rose from the telephone and joined
the card players. They shuffled and dealt
listlessly, seldom speaking save in monosyllables.</p>

<p>After a while Carfax went over to the
card table and the young lieutenant cashed in
and took his place at the telescope.</p>

<p>Below in the Alsatian valley spring had<pb n='14'/><anchor id='Pg14'/>
already started the fruit buds, and a delicate
green edged the lower snow line.</p>

<p>The lieutenant spoke of it wistfully; nobody
paid any attention; he rose presently
and went outdoors to the edge of the precipice&mdash;not
too near, for fear he might be
tempted to jump out through the sunshine,
down into that inviting world of promise
below.</p>

<p>Far underneath him&mdash;very far down in the
valley&mdash;a cuckoo called. Out of the depths
floated the elfin halloo, the gaily malicious
challenge of spring herself, shouted up melodiously
from the plains of Alsace&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Cuckoo!</hi>

<hi rend='italic'>Cuckoo!</hi> <hi rend='italic'>Cuckoo!</hi>&mdash;You poor, sullen, frozen
foreigner up there on the snowy rocks!&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Cuckoo!</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Cuckoo!</hi> <hi rend='italic'>Cuckoo!</hi></p>

<p>The lieutenant of Yukon infantry, whose
name was Gray, came back into the room.</p>

<p>"There's a bird of sorts yelling like hell
below," he said to the card players.</p>

<p>Carfax ran over his cards, rejected three,
and nodded. "Well, let him yell," he said.</p>

<p>"What is it, a Boche dicky-bird insulting
you?" asked Gary, in his Yankee drawl.</p>

<pb n='15'/><anchor id='Pg15'/>
<p>Flint, declining to draw cards, got up and
went out into the sunshine. When he returned
to the table, he said: "It's a cuckoo....
I wish to God I were out of this," he
added.</p>

<p>They continued to play for a while without
apparent interest. Each man had won
his comrades' money too many times to care
when Carfax added up debit and credit and
wrote down each man's score. In nine
months, alternately beggaring one another,
they had now, it appeared, broken about even.</p>

<p>Gary, an American in British uniform,
twitched a newspaper toward himself,
slouched in his chair, and continued to read
for a while. The paper was French and two
weeks old; he jerked it about irritably.</p>

<p>Gray, resting his elbows on his knees, sat
gazing vacantly out of the narrow window.
For a smart officer he had grown slovenly.</p>

<p>"If there was any trout fishing to be had,"
he began; but Flint laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at? There must
be trout in the valley down there where that
bird is," insisted Gray, reddening.</p>

<pb n='16'/><anchor id='Pg16'/>
<p>"Yes, and there are cows and chickens and
houses and women. What of it?"</p>

<p>Gary, in his faded service uniform of a
captain, scowled over his newspaper. "It's
bad enough to be here," he said heavily; "so
don't let's talk about it. Quit disputing."</p>

<p>Flint ignored the order.</p>

<p>"If there was anything sportin' to do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," muttered Carfax. "Do you
expect sport on a hog-back?"</p>

<p>Gray picked up a tennis ball and began to
play it against the whitewashed stone wall,
using the palm of his hand. Flint joined him
presently; Gary went over to the telephone, set
the receiver to his ear and spoke to some officer
in the distant valley on the French side, continuing
a spiritless conversation while watching
the handball play. After a while he rose,
shambled out and down among the rocks to the
spring where snow lay, trodden and filthy, and
the big, black salamanders crawled half stupefied
in the sun. All his loathing and fear of
them kindled again as it always did at sight
of them. "Dirty beasts," he muttered, stumping
and stumbling among the stunted fir<pb n='17'/><anchor id='Pg17'/>
trees; "some day they'll bite some of these
damn fools who say they can't bite. And
that'll end 'em."</p>

<p>Flint and Gray continued to play handball
in a perfunctory way while Carfax looked on
from the telephone without interest. Gary
came back, his shoes and puttees all over wet
snow.</p>

<p>"Unless," he said in a monotonous voice,
"something happens within the next few days
I'll begin to feel queer in my head; and if I
feel it coming on, I'll blow my bally nut off.
Or somebody's." And he touched his service
automatic in its holster and yawned.</p>

<p>After a dead silence:</p>

<p>"Buck up," remarked Carfax; "think how
our men must feel in Belfort, never letting
off their guns. Ross rifles, too&mdash;not a shot
at a Boche since the damn war began!"</p>

<p>"God!" said Flint, smiting the ball with
the palm of his hand, "to think of those Ross
rifles rusting down there and to think of the
pink-skinned pigs they could paunch so
cleanly. Did you ever paunch a deer? What
a mess of intestines all over the shop!"</p>

<pb n='18'/><anchor id='Pg18'/>
<p>Gary, still standing, began to kick the snow
from his shoes. Gray said to him: "For a
dollar of your Yankee money I'd give you a
shot at me with your automatic&mdash;you're that
slack at practice."</p>

<p>"If it goes on much longer like this I'll
not have to pay for a shot at anybody," returned
Gary, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>Gray laughed too, disagreeably, stretching
his facial muscles, but no sound issued.</p>

<p>"We're all going crazy together up here;
that's my idea," he said. "I don't know which
I can stand most comfortably, your voices or
your silence. Both make me sick."</p>

<p>"Some day a salamander will nip you;
then you'll go loco," observed Gary, balancing
another tennis ball in his right hand.
"Give me a shot at you?" he added. "I feel
as though I could throw it clean through you.
You look soft as a pudding to me."</p>

<p>Far, clear, from infinite depths, the elf-like
hail of the cuckoo came floating up to the
window.</p>

<p>To Flint, English born, the call meant
more than it did to Canadian or Yankee.</p>

<pb n='19'/><anchor id='Pg19'/>

<p>"In Devon," he said in an altered voice,
"they'll be calling just now. There's a world
of primroses in Devon.... And the thorn is
as white as the damned snow is up here."</p>

<p>Gary growled his impatience and his profile
of a Greek fighter showed in clean silhouette
against the window.</p>

<p>"Aw, hell," he said, "did I come out here
for this?&mdash;nine months of it?" He hurled the
tennis ball at the wall. "Can the home talk,
if you don't mind."</p>

<p>The cuckoo was still calling.</p>

<p>"Did you ever play cuckoo," asked Carfax,
"at ten shillings a throw? It's not a bad
game&mdash;if you're put to it for amusement."</p>

<p>Nobody replied; Gray's sunken, boyish face
betrayed no interest; he continued to toss a
tennis ball against the wall and catch it on
the rebound.</p>

<p>Toward sundown the usual Alpine chill set
in; a mist hung over the snow-edged cliffs;
the rocks breathed steam under a foggy and
battered moon.</p>

CUCKOO!</head>

<p>Carfax, on duty, sat hunched up over the
telephone, reporting to the fortress.</p>

<p>Gray came in, closed the wooden shutters,
hung blankets over them, lighted an oil stove
and then a candle. Flint took up the cards,
looked at Gary, then flung them aside, muttering.</p>

<p>Nobody attempted to read; nobody touched
the cards again. An orderly came in with
soup. The meal was brief and perfectly
silent.</p>

<p>Flint said casually, after the table had been
cleared: "I haven't slept for a month. If I
don't get some sleep I'll go queer. I warn
you; that's all. I'm sorry to say it, but
it's so."</p>

<p>"They're dirty beasts to keep us here like<pb n='21'/><anchor id='Pg21'/>
this," muttered Gary&mdash;"nine months of it, and
not a shot."</p>

<p>"There'll be a few shots if things don't
change," remarked Flint in a colourless voice.
"I'm getting wrong in my head. I can feel
it."</p>

<p>Carfax turned from the switchboard with
a forced laugh: "Thinking of shooting up the
camp?"</p>

<p>"That or myself," replied Flint in a quiet
voice; "ever since that cuckoo called I've felt
queer."</p>

<p>Gary, brooding in his soiled tunic collar,
began to mutter presently: "I once knew a
man in a lighthouse down in Florida who
couldn't stand it after a bit and jumped off."</p>

<p>"Oh, we've heard that twenty times," interrupted
Carfax wearily.</p>

<p>Gray said: "<hi rend='italic'>What</hi> a jump!&mdash;I mean down
into Alsace below&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're all going dotty!" snapped Carfax.
"Shut up or you'll be doing it&mdash;some of you."</p>

<p>"I can't sleep. That's where I'm getting
queer," insisted Flint. "If I could get a few
hours' sleep now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='22'/><anchor id='Pg22'/>
<p>"I wish to God the Boches could reach you
with a big gun. That would put you to sleep,
all right!" said Gray.</p>

<p>"This war is likely to end before any of
us see a Fritz," said Carfax. "I could stand
it, too, except being up here with such"&mdash;his
voice dwindled to a mutter, but it sounded
to Gary as though he had used the word
"rotters."</p>

<p>Flint's face had a white, strained expression;
he began to walk about, saying aloud
to himself: "If I could only sleep. That's
the idea&mdash;sleep it off, and wake up somewhere
else. It's the silence, or the voices&mdash;I don't
know which. You dollar-crazy Yankees and
ignorant Provincials don't realize what a
cuckoo is. You've no traditions, anyway&mdash;no
past, nothing to care for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to 'Arry!" retorted Gary&mdash;"'Arry
and his cuckoo!"</p>

<p>Carfax stirred heavily. "Shut up!" he
said, with an effort. "The thing is to keep
doing something&mdash;something&mdash;anything&mdash;except
quarrelling."</p>

<p>He picked up a tennis ball. "Come on, you<pb n='23'/><anchor id='Pg23'/>
funking brutes! I'll teach you how to play
cuckoo. Every man takes three tennis balls
and stands in a corner of the room. I stand
in the middle. Then you blow out the candle.
Then I call 'cuckoo!' in the dark and you
try to hit me, aiming by the sound of my
voice. Every time I'm hit I pay ten shillings
to the pool, take my place in a corner, and
have a shot at the next man, chosen by lot.
And if you throw three balls apiece and nobody
hits me, then you each pay ten shillings
to me and I'm cuckoo for another round."</p>

<p>"We aim at random?" inquired Gray,
mildly interested.</p>

<p>"Certainly. It must be played in pitch
darkness. When I call out cuckoo, you take
a shot at where you think I am. If you all
miss, you all pay. If I'm hit, I pay."</p>

<p>Gary chose three tennis balls and retired
to a corner of the room; Gray and Flint,
urged into action, took three each, unwillingly.</p>

<p>"Blow out the candle," said Carfax, who
had walked into the middle of the room.
Gary blew it out and the place was in darkness.</p>

<pb n='24'/><anchor id='Pg24'/>
<p>They thought they heard Carfax moving
cautiously, and presently he called, "Cuckoo!"
A storm of tennis balls rebounded from the
walls; "Cuckoo!" shouted Carfax, and the
tennis balls rained all around him.</p>

<p>Once more he called; not a ball hit him;
and he struck a match where he was seated
upon the floor.</p>

<p>There was some perfunctory laughter of a
feverish sort; the candle was relighted, tennis
balls redistributed, and Carfax wrote down
his winnings.</p>

<p>The next time, however, Gray, throwing
low, caught him. Again the candle was
lighted, scores jotted down, a coin tossed,
and Flint went in as cuckoo.</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible to miss a man
so near, even in total darkness, but Flint
lasted three rounds and was hit, finally, a
stinging smack on the ear. And then Gary
went in.</p>

<p>It was hot work, but they kept at it feverishly,
grimly, as though their very sanity depended
upon the violence of their diversion.
They threw the balls hard, viciously hard. A<pb n='25'/><anchor id='Pg25'/>

sort of silent ferocity seemed to seize them.
A chance hit cut the skin over Flint's cheekbone,
and when the candle was lighted, one
side of his face was bright with blood.</p>

<p>Early in the proceedings somebody had
disinterred brandy and Schnapps from under
a bunk. The room had become close; they
all were sweating.</p>

<p>Carfax emptied his iced glass, still breathing
hard, tossed a shilling and sent in Gary
as cuckoo.</p>

<p>Flint, who never could stand spirits, started
unsteadily for the candle, but could not seem
to blow it out. He stood swaying and balancing
on his heels, puffing out his smooth, boyish
cheeks and blowing at hazard.</p>

<p>"You're drunk," said Gray, thickly; but he
was as flushed as the boy he addressed, only
steadier of leg.</p>

<p>"What's that?" retorted Flint, jerking his
shoulders around and gazing at Gray out of
glassy eyes.</p>

<p>"Blow out that candle," said Gary heavily,
"or I'll shoot it out! Do you get that?"</p>

<p>"Shoot!" repeated Flint, staring vaguely<pb n='26'/><anchor id='Pg26'/>
into Gary's bloodshot eyes; "<hi rend='italic'>you</hi> shoot, you
old slacker&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up and play the game!" cut in Carfax,
a menacing roar rising in his voice.
"You're all slackers&mdash;and rotters, too. Play
the game! Keep playing&mdash;hard!&mdash;or you'll
go clean off your fool nuts!"</p>

<p>Gary walked heavily over and knocked the
tennis balls out of Flint's hands.</p>

<p>"There's a better game than that," he said,
his articulation very thick; "but it takes
nerve&mdash;if you've got it, you spindle-legged
little cockney!"</p>

<p>Flint struck at him aimlessly. "I've got
nerve," he muttered, "plenty of nerve, old
top! What d'you want? I'm your man; I'll
go you&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Go on with the game, I tell you!" bawled
Carfax.</p>

<p>Gary swung around: "Wait till I explain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't wait! Keep going! Keep
playing! Keep doing something, for God's
sake!"</p>

<pb n='27'/><anchor id='Pg27'/>
<p>"Will you wait!" shouted Gary. "I want
to tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carfax made a hopeless gesture: "It's talk
that will do the trick for us all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carfax shrugged, emptied his full glass
with a gesture of finality.</p>

<p>"Then talk, damn you! And we'll all be
at each other's throats before morning."</p>

<p>Gary got Gray by the elbow: "Reggie, it's
this way. We flip up for cuckoo. Whoever
gets stuck takes a shot apiece from our automatics
in the legs&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"It's perfectly agreeable to me," assented
Gray, in the mincing, elaborate voice characteristic
of him when drunk.</p>

<p>Flint wagged his head. "It's a sportin'
game. I'm in," he said.</p>

<p>Gary looked at Carfax. "A shot in the
dark at a man's legs. And if he gets his&mdash;it
will be Blighty in exchange for hell."</p>

<p>Carfax, sullen with liquor, shoved his big
hand into his pocket, produced a shilling, and
tossed it.</p>

<p>A brighter flush stained the faces which<pb n='28'/><anchor id='Pg28'/>
ringed him; the risky hazard of the affair
cleared their sick minds to comprehension.</p>

<p>Tails turned uppermost; Flint and Gary
were eliminated. It lay between Carfax and
Gray, and the older man won.</p>

<p>"Mind you fire low," said the young fellow,
with an excited laugh, and walked into
the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Gary blew out the candle. Presently from
somewhere in the intense darkness Gray
called "Cuckoo!" and instantly a slanting red
flash lashed out through the gloom. And,
when the deafening echo had nearly ceased:
"Cuckoo!"</p>

<p>Another pistol crashed. And after a swimming
interval they heard him moving.
"Cuckoo!" he called; a level flame stabbed
the dark; something fell, thudding through
the staccato uproar of the explosion. At
the same moment the outer door opened on
the crack and Carfax's orderly peeped in.</p>

<p>Carfax struck a match with shaky fingers;
the candle guttered, sank, flared on
Flint, who was laughing without a sound.
"Got the beggar, by God!" he whispered<pb n='29'/><anchor id='Pg29'/>&mdash;"through
the head! Look at him. Look at
Reggie Gray! Tried for his head and got
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He reeled back, chuckling foolishly, and
levelled at Carfax. "Now I'll get you!"
he simpered, and shot him through the
face.</p>

<p>As Carfax pitched forward, Gary fired.</p>

<p>"Missed me, by God!" laughed Flint.
"Shoot? Hell, yes. I'll show you how to
shoot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He struck the lighted candle with his left
hand and laughed again in the thick darkness.</p>

<p>"Shoot? I'll show you how to shoot, you
old slacker&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gary fired.</p>

<p>After a silence Flint giggled in the choking
darkness as the door opened cautiously
again, and shot at the terrified orderly.</p>

<p>"I'm a cockney, am I? And you don't
think much of the Devon cuckoos, do you?
Now I'll show you that I understand all
kinds of cuckoos&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='30'/><anchor id='Pg30'/>
<p>Both flashes split the obscurity at the same
moment. Flint fell back against the wall
and slid down to the floor. The outer door
began to open again cautiously.</p>

<p>But the orderly, half dressed, remained
knee-deep in the snow by the doorway.</p>

<p>After a long interval Gary struck a match,
then went over and lit the candle. And, as he
turned, Flint fired from where he lay on the
floor and Gary swung heavily on one heel, took
two uncertain steps. Then his pistol fell clattering;
he sank to his knees and collapsed face
downward on the stones.</p>

<p>Flint, still lying where he had fallen, partly
upright, against the wall, began to laugh,
and died a few moments later, the wind
from the slowly opening door stirring his
fair hair and extinguishing the candle.</p>

<p>And at last, through the opened door crept
Carfax's orderly; peered into the darkness
within, shivering in his unbuttoned tunic, his
boots wet with snow.</p>

<p>Dawn already whitened the east; and up
out of the ghastly fog edging the German
Empire, silhouetted, monstrous, against<pb n='31'/><anchor id='Pg31'/>
the daybreak, soared a <hi rend='italic'>L&auml;mmergeyer</hi>, beating
the livid void with enormous, unclean
wings.</p>

<p>The orderly heard its scream, shrank, cowering,
against the door frame as the huge
bird's ferocious red and yellow eyes blazed
level with his.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the clamor of the <hi rend='italic'>L&auml;mmergeyer</hi>,
the shrill bell of the telephone
began to ring.</p>

<p>The terrible racket of the <hi rend='italic'>L&auml;mmergeyer</hi>
filled the sky; the orderly stumbled into the
room, slipped in a puddle of something wet,
sent an empty bottle rolling and clinking
away into the darkness; stumbled twice over
prostrate bodies; reached the telephone, half
fainting; whispered for help.</p>

<p>After a long, long while, the horror still
thickly clogging vein and brain, he scratched
a match, hesitated, then holding it high,
reeled toward the door with face averted.</p>

<p>Outside the sun was already above the
horizon, flashing over Haut Alsace at his
feet.</p>

<pb n='32'/><anchor id='Pg32'/>
<p>The <hi rend='italic'>L&auml;mmergeyer</hi> was a speck in the sky,
poised over France.</p>

<p>Up out of the infinite and sunlit chasm
came a mocking, joyous hail&mdash;up through the
sheer, misty gulf out of vernal depths:
<hi rend='italic'>Cuck</hi>-oo! <hi rend='italic'>Cuck</hi>-oo! <hi rend='italic'>Cuck</hi>-oo!</p>

RECONNAISSANCE</head>

<p>And that was the way Carfax ended&mdash;a
tiny tragedy of incompetence compared to the
mountainous official fiasco at Gallipoli. Here,
a few perished among the filthy salamanders
in the snow; there, thousands died in the
burning Turkish gorse&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>But that's history; and its makers are
already officially damned.</p>

<p>But now concerning two others of the fed-up
dozen on board the mule transport&mdash;Harry
Stent and Jim Brown. Destiny linked
arms with them; Fate jerked a mysterious
thumb over her shoulder toward Italy.
Chance detailed them for special duty as
soon as they landed.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent sight, the disembark<pb n='34'/><anchor id='Pg34'/>ing
of the British overseas military force
sent secretly into Italy.</p>

<p>They continued to disembark and entrain
at night. Nobody knew that British troops
were in Italy.</p>

<p>The infernal uproar along the Isonzo never
ceased; the din of the guns resounded through
the Trentino, but British and Canadian noses
were sniffing at something beyond the Carnic
Alps, along the slopes of which they continued
to concentrate, Rifles, Kilties, and
Gunners.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no particular hurry.
Details from the Canadian contingent were
constantly sent out to familiarize themselves
with the vast waste of tunneled mountains
denting the Austrian sky-line to the northward;
and all day long Dominion reconnoitering
parties wandered among valleys, alms,
forest, and peaks in company sometimes with
Italian alpinists, sometimes by themselves,
prying, poking, snooping about with all the
emotionless pertinacity of Teuton tourists
preoccupied with <hi rend='italic'>wanderlust</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>kultur</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>ewigkeit</hi>.</p>

<pb n='35'/><anchor id='Pg35'/>

<p>And one lovely September morning the
British Military Observer with the Italian
army, and his very British aid, sat on a
sunny rock on the Col de la Reine and
watched a Canadian northward reconnaissance&mdash;nothing
much to see, except a solitary
moving figure here and there on the mountains,
crawling like a deerstalker across
ledges and stretches of bracken&mdash;a few dots
on the higher slopes, visible for a moment,
then again invisible, then glimpsed against
some lower snow patch, and gone again beyond
the range of powerful glasses.</p>

<p>"The Athabasca regiment, 13th Battalion,"
remarked the British Military Observer;
"lively and rather noisy."</p>

<p>"Really," observed his A.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>"Sturdy, half-disciplined beggars," continued
the B.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;O., watching the mountain
plank through his glasses; "every variety of
adventurer in their ranks&mdash;cattlemen, ranchmen,
Hudson Bay trappers, North West police,
lumbermen, mail carriers, bear hunters,
Indians, renegade frontiersmen, soldiers of
fortune&mdash;a sweet lot, Algy."</p>

<pb n='36'/><anchor id='Pg36'/>
<p>"Ow."</p>

<p>"&mdash;And half of 'em unruly Yankees&mdash;the
most objectionable half, you know."</p>

<p>"A bad lot," remarked the Honorable Algy.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the B.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;O. complacently;
"I've a relative of sorts with 'em&mdash;leftenant,
I believe&mdash;a Yankee brother-in-law,
in point of fact."</p>

<p>"Ow."</p>

<p>"Married a step-sister in the States. Must
look him up some day," concluded the B.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;O.,
adjusting his field glasses and focussing
them on two dark dots moving across a distant
waste of alpine roses along the edge
of a chasm.</p>

<p>One of the dots happened to be the "relative
of sorts" just mentioned; but the
B.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;O. could not know that. And a moment
afterward the dots became invisible
against the vast mass of the mountain, and
did not again reappear within the field of
the English officer's limited vision. So he
never knew he had seen his relative of sorts.</p>

<p>Up there on the alp, one of the dots, which
at near view appeared to be a good-looking,<pb n='37'/><anchor id='Pg37'/>
bronzed young man in khaki, puttees, and
mountain shoes, said to the other officer who
was scrambling over the rocks beside him:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a better country for
sheep?"</p>

<p>"Bear, elk, goats&mdash;it's sure a great layout,"
returned the younger officer, a Canadian
whose name was Stent.</p>

<p>"Goats," nodded Brown&mdash;"sheep and goats.
This country was made for them. I fancy
they <hi rend='italic'>have</hi> chamois here. Did you ever see
one, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They have a thing out here, too,
called an ibex. You never saw an ibex, did
you, Jim?"</p>

<p>Brown, who had halted, shook his head.
Stent stepped forward and stood silently beside
him, looking out across the vast cleft in
the mountains, but not using his field glasses.</p>

<p>At their feet the cliffs fell away sheer
into tremendous and dizzying depths; fir
forests far below carpeted the abyss like
wastes of velvet moss, amid which glistened
a twisted silvery thread&mdash;a river. A world
of mountains bounded the horizon.</p>

<pb n='38'/><anchor id='Pg38'/>
<p>"Better make a note or two," said Stent
briefly.</p>

<p>They unslung their rifles, seated themselves
in the warm sun amid a deep thicket of
alpine roses, and remained silent and busy
with pencil and paper for a while&mdash;two inconspicuous,
brownish-grey figures, cuddled
close among the greyish rocks, with nothing
of military insignia about their dress or their
round grey wool caps to differentiate them
from sportsmen&mdash;wary stalkers of chamois
or red deer&mdash;except that under their unbelted
tunics automatics and cartridge belts made
perceptible bunches.</p>

<p>Just above them a line of stunted firs
edged limits of perpetual snow, and rocks
and glistening fields of crag-broken white
carried the eye on upward to the dazzling
pinnacle of the Col de la Reine, splitting the
vast, calm blue above.</p>

<p>Nothing except peaks disturbed the tranquil
sky to the northward; not a cloud hung
there. But westward mist clung to a few
mountain flanks, and to the east it was snowing
on distant crests.</p>

<pb n='39'/><anchor id='Pg39'/>
<p>Brown, sketching rapidly but accurately,
laughed a little under his breath.</p>

<p>"To think," he said, "not a Boche dreams
we are in the Carnic Alps. It's very funny,
isn't it? Our surveyors are likely to be here
in a day or two, I fancy."</p>

<p>Stent, working more slowly and methodically
on his squared map paper, the smoke
drifting fragrantly from his brier pipe,
nodded in silence, glancing down now and
then at the barometer and compass between
them.</p>

<p>"Mentioning big game," he remarked presently,
"I started to tell you about the ibex,
Jim. I've hunted a little in the Eastern
Alps."</p>

<p>"I didn't know it," said Brown, interested.</p>

<p>"Yes. A classmate of mine at the Munich
Polytechnic invited me&mdash;Siurd von Glahn&mdash;a
splendid fellow&mdash;educated at Oxford&mdash;just
like one of us&mdash;nothing of the Boche about
him at all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brown laughed: "A Boche is always
a Boche, Harry. The black Prussian
blood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='40'/><anchor id='Pg40'/>
<p>"No; Siurd was all white. Really. A
charming, lovable fellow. Anyway, his dad
had a shooting where there were chamois,
reh, hirsch, and the king of all Alpine big
game&mdash;ibex. And Siurd asked me."</p>

<p>"Did you get an ibex?" inquired Brown,
sharpening his pencil and glancing out across
the valley at a cloud which had suddenly
formed there.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"What manner of beast is it?"</p>

<p>"It has mountain sheep and goats stung
to death. Take it from me, Jim, it's the last
word in mountain sport. The chamois isn't
in it. Pooh, I've seen chamois within a hundred
yards of a mountain macadam highway.
But the ibex? Not much! The man
who stalks and kills an ibex has nothing
more to learn about stalking. Chamois, red
deer, Scotch stag make you laugh after you've
done your bit in the ibex line."</p>

<p>"How about our sheep and goat?" inquired
Brown, staring at his comrade.</p>

<p>"It's harder to get ibex."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<pb n='41'/><anchor id='Pg41'/>
<p>"It really is, Jim."</p>

<p>"What does your ibex resemble?"</p>

<p>"It's a handsome beast, ashy grey in summer,
furred a brownish yellow in winter, and
with little chin whiskers and a pair of big,
curved, heavily ridged horns, thick and flat
and looking as though they ought to belong
to something African, and twice as big."</p>

<p>"Some trophy, what?" commented Brown,
working away at his sketches.</p>

<p>"Rather. The devilish thing lives along the
perpetual snow line; and, for incredible stunts
in jumping and climbing, it can give points
to any Rocky Mountain goat. You try to get
above it, spend the night there, and stalk it
when it returns from nocturnal grazing in the
stunted growth below. That's how."</p>

<p>"And you got one?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It took six days. We followed it for
that length of time across the icy mountains,
Siurd and I. I thought I'd die."</p>

<p>"Cold work, eh?"</p>

<p>Stent nodded, pocketed his sketch, fished out
a packet of bread and chocolate from his pocket
and, rolling over luxuriously in the sun among<pb n='42'/><anchor id='Pg42'/>
the alpine roses, lunched leisurely, flat on his
back.</p>

<p>Brown presently stretched out and reclined
on his elbow; and while he ate he lazily watched
a kestrel circling deep in the gulf below him.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, half to himself, "that this
is the most beautiful region on earth."</p>

<p>Stent lifted himself on both elbows and gazed
across the chasm at the lower slopes of the alm
opposite, all ablaze with dewy wild flowers.
Down it, between fern and crag and bracken,
flashed a brook, broken into in silvery sections
amid depths of velvet green below, where evidently
it tumbled headlong into that thin, shining
thread which was a broad river.</p>

<p>"Yes," mused Stent, "Siurd von Glahn and
I were comrades on many a foot tour through
such mountains as these. He was a delightful
fellow, my classmate Siurd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brown's swift rigid grip on his arm checked
him to silence; there came the clink of an
iron-shod foot on the ledge; they snatched their
rifles from the fern patch; two figures stepped
around the shelf of rock, looming up dark
against the dazzling sky.</p>

PARNASSUS</head>

<p>Brown, squatting cross-legged among the
alpine roses, squinted along his level rifle.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he said with a pleasant, rising inflection
in his quiet voice. "Stand very still,
gentlemen," he added in German.</p>

<p>"Drop your rifles. Drop 'em quick!" he
repeated more sharply. "Up with your hands&mdash;hold
them up high! Higher, if you please!&mdash;quickly.
Now, then, what are you doing on this
alp?"</p>

<p>What they were doing seemed apparent
enough&mdash;two gentlemen of Teutonic persuasion,
out stalking game&mdash;deer, rehbok or chamois&mdash;one
a tall, dark, nice-looking young fellow
wearing the usual rough gray jacket with
stag-horn buttons, green felt hat with feather,
and leather breeches of the alpine hunter. His<pb n='44'/><anchor id='Pg44'/>
knees and aristocratic ankles were bare and
bronzed. He laughed a little as he held up his
arms.</p>

<p>The other man was stout and stocky rather
than fat. He had the square red face and
bushy beard of a beer-nourished Teuton and
the spectacles of a Herr Professor. He held
up his blunt hands with all ten stubby fingers
spread out wide. They seemed rather soiled.</p>

<p>From his <hi rend='italic'>r&uuml;cksack</hi> stuck out a butterfly
net in two sections and the deeply scalloped,
silver-trimmed butt of a sporting rifle. Edelweiss
adorned his green felt hat; a green tin
box punched full of holes was slung from his
broad shoulders.</p>

<p>Brown, lowering his rifle cautiously, was already
getting to his feet from the trampled
bracken, when, behind him, he heard Stent's
astonished voice break forth in pedantic German:</p>

<p>"Siurd! Is it <hi rend='italic'>thou</hi> then?"</p>

<p>"Harry Stent!" returned the dark, nice-looking
young fellow amiably. And, in a delightful
voice and charming English:</p>

<p>"Pray, am I to offer you a shake hands," he<pb n='45'/><anchor id='Pg45'/>
inquired smilingly; "or shall I continue to invoke
the Olympian gods with classically uplifted
and imploring arms?"</p>

<p>Brown let Stent pass forward. Then, stepping
back, he watched the greeting between
these two old classmates. His rifle, grasped
between stock and barrel, hung loosely between
both hands. His expression became vacantly
good humoured; but his brain was working like
lightning.</p>

<p>Stent's firm hand encountered Von Glahn's
and held it in questioning astonishment. Looking
him in the eyes he said slowly: "Siurd, it
is good to see you again. It is amazing to
meet you this way. I am glad. I have never
forgotten you.... Only a moment ago I was
speaking to Brown about you&mdash;of our wonderful
ibex hunt! I was telling Brown&mdash;my
comrade&mdash;" he turned his head slightly and
presented the two young men&mdash;"Mr. Brown,
an American&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"American?" repeated Von Glahn in his gentle,
well-bred voice, offering his hand. And, in
turn, becoming sponsor, he presented his stocky
companion as Dr. von Dresslin; and the cere<pb n='46'/><anchor id='Pg46'/>mony
instantly stiffened to a more rigid etiquette.</p>

<p>Then, in his always gentle, graceful way,
Von Glahn rested his hand lightly on Stent's
shoulder:</p>

<p>"You made us jump&mdash;you two Americans&mdash;as
though you had been British. Of what could
two Americans be afraid in the Carnic Alps
to challenge a pair of wandering ibex stalkers?"</p>

<p>"You forget that I am Canadian," replied
Stent, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p>"At that, you are practically American and
civilian&mdash;" He glanced smilingly over their
equipment, carelessly it seemed to Stent, as
though verifying all absence of military insignia.
"Besides," he added with his gentle
humour, "there are no British in Italy. And
no Italians in these mountains, I fancy; they
have their own affairs to occupy them on the
Isonzo I understand. Also, there is no war between
Italy and Germany."</p>

<p>Stent smiled, perfectly conscious of Brown's
telepathic support in whatever was now to
pass between them and these two Germans. He<pb n='47'/><anchor id='Pg47'/>
knew, and Brown knew, that these Germans
must be taken back as prisoners; that, suspicious
or not, they could not be permitted
to depart again with a story of having met
an American and a Canadian after ibex among
the Carnic Alps.</p>

<p>These two Germans were already their prisoners;
but there was no hurry about telling
them so.</p>

<p>"How do you happen to be here, Siurd?"
asked Stent, frankly curious.</p>

<p>Von Glahn lifted his delicately formed eyebrows,
then, amused:</p>

<p>"Count von Plessis invites me; and"&mdash;he
laughed outright&mdash;"he must have invited you,
Harry, unless you are poaching!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Stent, for a brief
second believing in the part he was playing;
"I supposed this to be a free alp."</p>

<p>He and Von Glahn laughed; and the latter
said, still frankly amused: "<hi rend='italic'>Soyez tranquille</hi>,
Messieurs; Count von Plessis permits my
friends&mdash;in my company&mdash;to shoot the Queen's
alm."</p>

<p>With a lithe movement, wholly graceful, he<pb n='48'/><anchor id='Pg48'/>
slipped the <hi rend='italic'>r&uuml;cksack</hi> from his shoulders, let
it fall among the <hi rend='italic'>alpenrosen</hi> beside his sporting
rifle.</p>

<p>"We have a long day and a longer night
ahead of us," he said pleasantly, looking from
Stent to Brown. "The snow limit lies just
above us; the ibex should pass here at dawn
on their way back to the peak. Shall we consolidate
our front, gentlemen&mdash;and make it
a Quadruple Entente?"</p>

<p>Stent replied instantly: "We join you with
thanks, Siurd. My one ibex hunt is no experience
at all compared to your record of a
veteran&mdash;" He looked full and significantly
at Brown; continuing: "As you say, we have
all day and&mdash;a long night before us. Let us
make ourselves comfortable here in the sun
before we take&mdash;our final stations."</p>

<p>And they seated themselves in the lee of the
crag, foregathering fraternally in the warm
alpine sunshine.</p>

<p>The Herr Professor von Dresslin grunted
as he sat down. After he had lighted his pipe
he grunted again, screwed together his butter<pb n='49'/><anchor id='Pg49'/>fly
net and gazed hard through thick-lensed
spectacles at Brown.</p>

<p>"Does it interest you, sir, the pursuit of the
diurnal Lepidoptera?" he inquired, still staring
intently at the American.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about them," explained
Brown. "What are Lepidoptera?"</p>

<p>"The <hi rend='italic'>schmetterling</hi>&mdash;the butterfly. In Amerika,
sir, you have many fine species, notably
Parnassus clodius and the Parnassus smintheus
of the four varietal forms." His prominent
eyes shifted from one detail of Brown's costume
to another&mdash;not apparently an intelligent
examination, but a sort of protruding and
indifferent stare.</p>

<p>His gaze, however, was arrested for a moment
where the lump under Brown's tunic indicated
something concealed&mdash;a hunting knife,
for example. Brown's automatic was strapped
there. But the bulging eyes, expressionless
still, remained fixed for a second only, then
travelled on toward the Ross rifle&mdash;the Athabasca
Regiment having been permitted to exchange
this beloved weapon for the British
regulation piece recently issued to the Can<pb n='50'/><anchor id='Pg50'/>adians.
From behind the thick lenses of his
spectacles the Herr Professor examined the
rifle while his monotonously dreary voice continued
an entomological monologue for Brown's
edification. And all the while Von Glahn and
Stent, reclining nearby among the ferns, were
exchanging what appeared to be the frankest
of confidences and the happiest of youthful
reminiscences.</p>

<p>"Of the Parnassians," rumbled on Professor
von Dresslin, "here in the Alps we possess
one notable example&mdash;namely, the Parnassus
Apollo. It is for the capture of this never-to-be-sufficiently
studied butterfly that I have,
upon this ibex-hunting expedition, myself
equipped with net and suitable paraphernalia."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Brown, eyeing the green tin
box and the net. The Herr Professor's pop-eyed
attention was now occupied with the service
puttees worn by Brown. A sportsman also
might have worn them, of course.</p>

<p>"The Apollo butterfly," droned on Professor
Dresslin, "iss a butterfly of the larger magnitude
among European Lepidoptera, yet not of
the largest. The Parnassians, allied to the<pb n='51'/><anchor id='Pg51'/>
Papilionid&aelig;, all live only in high altitudes,
and are, by the thinly scaled and always-to-be-remembered
red and plack ge-spotted wings,
to be readily recognized. I haf already two
specimens captured this morning. I haff the
honour, sir, to exhibit them for your inspection&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He fished out a flat green box from his pocket,
opened it under Brown's nose, leaning close
enough to touch Brown with an exploring and
furtive elbow&mdash;and felt the contour of the
automatic.</p>

<p>Amid a smell of carbolic and camphor cones
Brown beheld, pinned side by side upon the
cork-lined interior of the box, two curiously
pretty butterflies.</p>

<p>Their drooping and still pliable wings
seemed as thin as white tissue paper; their
bodies were covered with furry hairs. Brick-red
and black spots decorated the frail membrane
of the wings in a curiously pleasing
harmony of pattern and of colour.</p>

<p>"Very unusual," he said, with a vague idea
he was saying the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Monotonously, paying no attention, Professor<pb n='52'/><anchor id='Pg52'/>
von Dresslin continued: "I, the life history of
the Parnassus Apollo, haff from my early
youth investigated with minuteness, diligence,
and patience."&mdash;His protuberant eyes were now
fixed on Brown's rifle again.&mdash;"For many years
I haff bred this Apollo butterfly from the egg,
from the caterpillar, from the chrysalis. I have
the negroid forms, the albino forms, the dwarf
forms, the hybrid forms investigated under
effery climatic condition. Notes sufficient for
three volumes of quarto already exist as a
residuum of my investigations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked up suddenly into the American's
face&mdash;which was the first sudden movement the
Herr Professor had made&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ach wass! Three volumes! It is nothing.
Here iss material for thirty!&mdash;A lifetime iss
too short to know all the secrets of a single
species.... If I may inquire, sir, of what
pattern is your most interesting and admirable
rifle?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;Ross," said Brown, startled into a second's
hesitation.</p>

<p>"So? And, if I may inquire, of what nationality
iss it, a R-r-ross?"</p>

<pb n='53'/><anchor id='Pg53'/>

<p>"It's a Canadian weapon. We Americans use
it a great deal for big game."</p>

<p>"So?... And it iss also by the Canadian
military employed perhaps, sir?"</p>

<p>"I believe," said Brown, carelessly, "that the
British Government has taken away the Ross
rifle from the Canadians and given them the
regulation weapon."</p>

<p>"So? Permit&mdash;that I examine, sir?"</p>

<p>Brown did not seem to hear him or notice
the extended hand&mdash;blunt-fingered, hairy, persistent.</p>

<p>The Professor, not discouraged, repeated:
"Sir, <hi rend='italic'>bitte darf ich</hi>, may I be permitted?"
And Brown's eyes flashed back a lightning
shaft of inquiry. Then, carelessly smiling, he
passed the Ross rifle over to the Herr Professor;
and, at the same time, drew toward him
that gentleman's silver-mounted weapon, and
carelessly cocked it.</p>

<p>"Permit me," he murmured, balancing it innocently
in the hollow of his left arm, apparently
preoccupied with admiration at the florid
workmanship of stock and guard. No movement
that the Herr Professor made escaped<pb n='54'/><anchor id='Pg54'/>
him; but presently he thought to himself&mdash;"The
old dodo is absolutely unsuspicious. My
nerves are out of order.... What odd eyes
that Fritz has!"</p>

<p>When Herr Professor von Dresslin passed
back the weapon Brown laid the German sporting
piece beside it with murmured complimentary
comment.</p>

<p>"Yess," said the German, "such rifles kill
when properly handled. We Germans may
cordially recommend them for our American&mdash;friends&mdash;"
Here was the slightest hesitation&mdash;"Pardon!
I mean that we may safely
guarantee this rifle <hi rend='italic'>to</hi> our friends."</p>

<p>Brown looked thoughtfully at the thick lenses
of the spectacles. The popeyes remained expressionless,
utterly, Teutonically inscrutable.
A big heather bee came buzzing among the
<hi rend='italic'>alpenrosen</hi>. Its droning hum resembled the
monotone of the Herr Professor.</p>

<p>Behind them Brown heard Stent saying: "Do
you remember our ambition to wear the laurels
of Parnassus, Siurd? Do you remember our
notes at the lectures on the poets? And our<pb n='55'/><anchor id='Pg55'/>
ambition to write at least one deathless poem
apiece before we died?"</p>

<p>Von Glahn's dark eyes narrowed with merriment
and his gentle laugh and attractive voice
sounded pleasantly in Brown's ears.</p>

<p>"You wrote at least <hi rend='italic'>one</hi> famous poem to
Rosa," he said, still laughing.</p>

<p>"To Rosa? Oh! Rosa of the Caf&eacute; Luitpold!
By Jove I did, didn't I, Siurd? How on earth
did you ever remember that?"</p>

<p>"I thought it very pretty." He began to repeat
aloud:</p>

<lg rend='stanza'>
<l>"Rosa with the winsome eyes,</l>
<l>When my beer you bring to me;</l>
<l>I can see through your disguise!</l>
<l>I my goddess recognize&mdash;</l>

<l>Hebe, young immortally,</l>
<l>Sweet nepenthe pouring me!"</l>
</lg>

<p>Stent laughed outright:</p>

<p>"How funny to think of it now&mdash;and to think
of Rosa!... And you, Siurd, do you forget
that you also composed a most wonderful
war-poem&mdash;to the metre of 'Fly, Eagle, Fly!'
Do you remember how it began?</p>

<pb n='56'/><anchor id='Pg56'/>
<lg rend='stanza'>
<l>"Slay, Eagle, Slay!</l>

<l rend='i2'>They die who dare decry us!</l>
<l>Red dawns 'The Day.'</l>
<l rend='i2'>The western cliffs defy us!</l>
<l>Turn their grey flood</l>
<l>To seas of blood!</l>
<l>And, as they flee, Slay, Eagle! Slay!</l>
<l>For God has willed this German 'Day'!"</l>
</lg>

<p>"Enough," said Siurd Von Glahn, still laughing,
but turning very red. "What a terrible
memory you have, Harry! For heaven's sake
spare my modesty such accurate reminiscences."</p>

<p>"I thought it fine poetry&mdash;then," insisted
Stent with a forced smile. But his voice had
subtly altered.</p>

<p>They looked at each other in silence, the
reminiscent smile still stamped upon their stiffening
lips.</p>

<p>For a brief moment the years had seemed
to fade&mdash;time was not&mdash;the sunshine of that
careless golden age had seemed to warm them
once again there where they sat amid the
<hi rend='italic'>alpenrosen</hi> below the snow line on the Col de
la Reine.</p>

<pb n='57'/><anchor id='Pg57'/>

<p>But it did not endure; everything concerning
earth and heaven and life and death had
so far remained unsaid between these two.
And never would be said. Both understood
that, perhaps.</p>

<p>Then Von Glahn's sidelong and preoccupied
glance fell on Stent's field glasses slung short
around his neck. His rigid smile died out.
Soldiers wore field glasses that way; hunters,
when they carried them instead of spyglasses,
wore them <hi rend='italic'>en bandouli&egrave;re</hi>.</p>

<p>He spoke, however, of other matters in his
gentle, thoughtful voice&mdash;avoiding always any
mention of politics and war&mdash;chatted on pleasantly
with the familiarity and insouciance of
old acquaintance. Once he turned slowly and
looked at Brown&mdash;addressed him politely&mdash;while
his dark eyes wandered over the American,
noting every detail of dress and equipment, and
the slight bulge at his belt line beneath the
tunic.</p>

<p>Twice he found pretext to pick up his rifle,
but discarded it carelessly, apparently not noticing
that Stent and Brown always resumed
their own weapons when he touched his.</p>

<pb n='58'/><anchor id='Pg58'/>
<p>Brown said to Von Glahn:</p>

<p>"Ibex stalking is a new game to me. My
friend Stent tells me that you are old at it."</p>

<p>"I have followed some few ibex, Mr. Brown,"
replied the young man modestly. "And&mdash;other
game," he added with a shrug.</p>

<p>"I know how it's done in theory," continued
the American; "and I am wondering whether
we are to lie in this spot until dawn tomorrow
or whether we climb higher and lie in the
snow up there."</p>

<p>"In the snow, perhaps. God knows exactly
where we shall lie tonight&mdash;Mr. Brown."</p>

<p>There was an odd look in Siurd's soft brown
eyes; he turned and spoke to Herr Professor
von Dresslin, using dialect&mdash;and instantly appearing
to recollect himself he asked pardon
of Stent and Brown in his very perfect English.</p>

<p>"I said to the Herr Professor in the Traun
dialect: 'Ibex may be stirring, as it is already
late afternoon. We ought now to use our
glasses.' My family," he added apologetically,
"come from the Traunwald; I forget and employ
the vernacular at times."</p>

<pb n='59'/><anchor id='Pg59'/>
<p>The Herr Professor unslung his telescope,
set his rifle upright on the moss, and, kneeling,
balanced the long spyglass alongside of
the blued-steel barrel, resting it on his hand
as an archer fits the arrow he is drawing on
the bowstring.</p>

<p>Instantly both Brown and Stent thought of
the same thing: the chance that these Germans
might spy others of the Athabasca regiment
prowling among the ferns and rocks of
neighbouring slopes. The game was nearly
at an end, anyway.</p>

<p>They exchanged a glance; both picked up
their rifles; Brown nodded almost imperceptibly.
The tragic comedy was approaching its
close.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Hirsch</hi>" grunted the Herr Professor&mdash;"<hi rend='italic'>und
st&uuml;ck</hi>&mdash;on the north alm"&mdash;staring through his
telescope intently.</p>

<p>"Accorded," said Siurd Von Glahn, balancing
his spyglass and sweeping the distant crags.
"<hi rend='italic'>St&uuml;ck</hi> on the western shoulder," he added&mdash;"and
a stag royal among them."</p>

<p>"Of ten?"</p>

<p>"Of twelve."</p>

<pb n='60'/><anchor id='Pg60'/>
<p>After a silence: "Why are they galloping&mdash;I
wonder&mdash;the herd-stag and <hi rend='italic'>st&uuml;ck</hi>?"</p>

<p>Brown very quietly laid one hand on Stent's
arm.</p>

<p>"A <hi rend='italic'>geier</hi>, perhaps," suggested Siurd, his eye
glued to his spyglass.</p>

<p>"No ibex?" asked Stent in a voice a little
forced.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Noch nicht, mon ami. Tiens! A gemsbok</hi>&mdash;high
on the third peak&mdash;feeding."</p>

<p>"Accorded," grunted the Herr Professor
after an interval of search; and he closed his
spyglass and placed his rifle on the moss.</p>

<p>His staring, protuberant eyes fell casually
upon Brown, who was laying aside his own
rifle again&mdash;and the German's expression did
not alter.</p>

<p>"Ibex!" exclaimed Von Glahn softly.</p>

<p>Stent, rising impulsively to his feet, bracketted
his field glasses on the third peak, and
stood there, poised, slim and upright against
the sky on the chasm's mossy edge.</p>

<p>"I don't see your ibex, Siurd," he said, still
searching.</p>

<p>"On the third peak, <hi rend='italic'>mon ami</hi>"&mdash;drawing<pb n='61'/><anchor id='Pg61'/>

Stent familiarly to his side&mdash;the lightest caressing
contact&mdash;merely enough to verify the
existence of the automatic under his old classmate's
tunic.</p>

<p>If Stent did not notice the impalpable touch,
neither did Brown notice it, watching them.
Perhaps the Herr Professor did, but it is not
at all certain, because at that moment there
came flopping along over the bracken and <hi rend='italic'>alpenrosen</hi>
a loppy winged butterfly&mdash;a large, whitish
creature, seeming uncertain in its irresolute
flight whether to alight at Brown's feet or
go flapping aimlessly on over Brown's head.</p>

<p>The Herr Professor snatched up his net&mdash;struck
heavily toward the winged thing&mdash;a silent,
terrible, sweeping blow with net and rifle
clutched together. Brown went down with a
crash.</p>

<p>At the shocking sound of the impact Stent
wheeled from the abyss, then staggered back
under the powerful shove from Von Glahn's
nervous arm. Swaying, fighting frantically for
foothold, there on the chasm's awful edge, he
balanced for an instant; fought for equilibrium.
Von Glahn, rigid, watched him. Then, deathly<pb n='62'/><anchor id='Pg62'/>
white, his young eyes looking straight into the
eyes of his old classmate&mdash;Stent lost the fight,
fell outward, wider, dropping back into mid-air,
down through sheer, tremendous depths&mdash;down
there where the broad river seemed only
a silver thread and the forests looked like beds
of tender, velvet moss.</p>

<p>After him, fluttering irresolutely, flitted Parnassus
Apollo, still winging its erratic way
where God willed it&mdash;a frail, dainty, translucent,
wind-blown fleck of white above the gulf&mdash;symbol,
perhaps of the soul already soaring
up out of the terrific deeps below.</p>

<p>The Herr Professor sweated and panted as
he tugged at the silk handkerchief with which
he was busily knotting the arms of the unconscious
American behind his back.</p>

<p>"Pouf! Ugh! Pig-dog!" he grunted&mdash;"mit
his pockets full of automatic clips. A Yankee,
eh? What I tell you, Siurd?&mdash;English and
Yankee they are one in blood and one at
heart&mdash;pig-dogs effery one. Hey, Siurd, what
I told you already <hi rend='italic'>gesternabend</hi>? The British

<hi rend='italic'>schwein</hi> are in Italy already. Hola! Siurd!
Take his feet and we turn him over <hi rend='italic'>mal</hi>!"</p>

<pb n='63'/><anchor id='Pg63'/>
<p>But Von Glahn remained motionless, leaning
heavily against the crag, his back to the abyss,
his blond head buried in both arms.</p>

<p>So the Herr Professor, who was a major, too,
began, with his powerful, stubby hands, to pull
the unconscious man over on his back. And,
as he worked, he hummed monotonously but
contentedly in his bushy beard something about
<hi rend='italic'>something</hi> being "<hi rend='italic'>&uuml;ber alles</hi>"&mdash;God, perhaps,
perhaps the blue sky overhead which covered
him and his sickened friend alike, and the hurt
enemy whose closed lids shut out the sky above&mdash;and
the dead man lying very, very far below
them&mdash;where river and forest and moss and
Parnassus were now alike to him.</p>

IN FINIST&Egrave;RE</head>

<p>It was a dirty trick that they played Stent
and Brown&mdash;the three Mysterious Sisters, Fate,
Chance, and Destiny. But they're always billed
for any performance, be it vaudeville or tragedy;
and there's no use hissing them off:
they'll dog you from the stage entrance if they
take a fancy to you.</p>

<p>They dogged Wayland from the dock at
Calais, where the mule transport landed, all
the way to Paris, then on a slow train to Quimperl&eacute;,
and then, by stagecoach, to that little
lost house on the moors, where ties held him
most closely&mdash;where all he cared for in this
world was gathered under a humble roof.</p>

<p>In spite of his lameness he went duck-shooting
the week after his arrival. It was rather
forcing his convalescence, but he believed it<pb n='65'/><anchor id='Pg65'/>
would accelerate it to go about in the open air,
as though there were nothing the matter with
his shattered leg.</p>

<p>So he hobbled down to the point he knew so
well. He had longed for the sea off Eryx.
It thundered at his feet.</p>

<p>And, now, all around him through clamorous
obscurity a watery light glimmered; it
edged the low-driven clouds hurrying in from
the sea; it outlined the long point of rocks
thrust southward into the smoking smother.</p>

<p>The din of the surf filled his ears; through
flying patches of mist he caught glimpses of
rollers bursting white against the reef; heard
duller detonations along unseen sands, and
shattering reports where heavy waves exploded
among basalt rocks.</p>

<p>His lean face of an invalid glistened with
spray; salt water dripped from cap and coat,
spangled the brown barrels of his fowling-piece,
and ran down the varnished supports of
both crutches where he leaned on them, braced
forward against an ever-rising wind.</p>

<p>At moments he seemed to catch glimpses of
darker specks dotting the heaving flank of some<pb n='66'/><anchor id='Pg66'/>
huge wave. But it was not until the wild ducks
rose through the phantom light and came whirring
in from the sea that his gun, poked stiffly
skyward, flashed in the pallid void. And then,
sometimes, he hobbled back after the dead
quarry while it still drove headlong inland,
slanting earthward before the gale.</p>

<p>Once, amid the endless thundering, in the
turbulent desolation around him, through the
roar of wind in his ears, he seemed to catch
deadened sounds resembling distant seaward
cannonading&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>real</hi> cannonading&mdash;as though
individual shots, dully distinct, dominated
for a few moments the unbroken uproar of
surf and gale.</p>

<p>He listened, straining his ears, alert, intent
upon the sounds he ought to recognize&mdash;the
sounds he knew so well.</p>

<p>Only the ceaseless pounding of the sea
assailed his ears.</p>

<p>Three wild duck, widgeon, came speeding
through the fog; he breasted the wind, balanced
heavily on both crutches and one leg,
and shoved his gun upward.</p>

<p>At the same instant the mist in front and<pb n='67'/><anchor id='Pg67'/>
overhead became noisy with wild fowl, rising
in one great, panic-stricken, clamoring
cloud. He hesitated; a muffled, thudding
sound came to him over the unseen sea, growing
louder, nearer, dominating the gale, increasing
to a rattling clatter.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great cloudy shape loomed up
through the whirling mist ahead&mdash;an enormous
shadow in the fog&mdash;a gigantic spectre
rushing inland on vast and ghostly pinions.</p>

<p>As the man shrank on his crutches, looking
up, the a&euml;roplane swept past overhead&mdash;a
wounded, wavering, unsteady, unbalanced
thing, its right aileron dangling, half stripped,
and almost mangled to a skeleton.</p>

<p>Already it was slanting lower toward the
forest like a hard-hit duck, wing-crippled,
fighting desperately for flight-power to the
very end. Then the inland mist engulfed it.</p>

<p>And after it hobbled Wayland, painfully,
two brace of dead ducks and his slung fowling
piece bobbing on his back, his rubber-shod
crutches groping and probing among
drenched rocks and gullies full of kelp, his
left leg in splints hanging heavily.</p>

<pb n='68'/><anchor id='Pg68'/>
<p>He could not go fast; he could not go
very far. Further inland, foggy gorse gave
place to broom and blighted bracken, all wet,
sagging with rain. Then he crossed a swale
of brown reeds and tussock set with little
pools of water, opaque and grey in the rain.</p>

<p>Where the outer moors narrowed he turned
westward; then a strip of low, thorn-clad
cliff confronted him, up which he toiled along
a V-shaped cleft choked with ferns.</p>

<p>The spectral forest of L&auml;is lay just beyond,
its wind-tortured branches tossing under
a leaden sky.</p>

<p>East and west lonely moors stretched away
into the depths of the mist; southward spread
the sea; to the north lay the wide woods of
L&auml;is, equally deserted now in this sad and
empty land.</p>

<p>He hobbled to the edge of the forest and
stood knee deep in discoloured ferns, listening.
The sombre beech-woods spread thick
on either hand, a wilderness of crossed limbs
and meshed branches to which still clung
great clots of dull brown leaves.</p>

<p>He listened, peering into sinister, grey<pb n='69'/><anchor id='Pg69'/>
depths. In the uncertain light nothing stirred
except the clashing branches overhead; there
was no sound except the wind's flowing roar
and the ghostly noise of his own voice, hallooing
through the solitude&mdash;a voice in the misty
void that seemed to carry less sound than
the straining cry of a sleeper in his dreams.</p>

<p>If the a&euml;roplane had landed, there was no
sign here. How far had it struggled on,
sheering the tree-tops, before it fell?&mdash;if indeed
it had fallen somewhere in the wood's
grey depths?</p>

<p>As long as he had sufficient strength he
prowled along the forest, entering it here
and there, calling, listening, searching the
foggy corridors of trees. The rotting brake
crackled underfoot; the tree tops clashed and
creaked above him.</p>

<p>At last, having only enough strength left
to take him home, he turned away, limping
through the blotched and broken ferns, his
crippled leg hanging stiffly in its splints, his
gun and the dead ducks bobbing on his back.</p>

<p>The trodden way was soggy with little
pools full of drenched grasses and dead<pb n='70'/><anchor id='Pg70'/>
leaves; but at length came rising ground,
and the blue-green, glimmering wastes of
gorse stretching away before him through the
curtained fog.</p>

<p>A sheep path ran through; and after a little
while a few trees loomed shadowy in the
mist, and a low stone house took shape,
whitewashed, flanked by barn, pigpen, and a
stack of rotting seaweed.</p>

<p>A few wet hens wandered aimlessly by the
doorstep; a tiny bed of white clove-pinks
and tall white phlox exhaled a homely welcome
as the lame man hobbled up the steps,
pulled the leather latchstring, and entered.</p>

<p>In the kitchen an old Breton woman, chopping
herbs, looked up at him out of aged
eyes, shaking her head under its white coiffe.</p>

<p>"It is nearly noon," she said. "You have
been out since dawn. Was it wise, for a convalescent,
Monsieur Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Very wise, Marie-Josephine. Because the
more exercise I take the sooner I shall be
able to go back."</p>

<p>"It is too soon to go out in such weather."</p>

<p>"Ducks fly inland only in such weather,"<pb n='71'/><anchor id='Pg71'/>
he retorted, smiling. "And we like roast
widgeon, you and I, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>And all the while her aged blue eyes were
fixed on him, and over her withered cheeks
the soft bloom came and faded&mdash;that pretty
colour which Breton women usually retain
until the end.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest, Monsieur Jacques," she
said, with a curiously quaint mingling of
familiarity and respect, "that I do not counsel
caution because I love thee and dread
for thee again the trenches. But with thy
leg hanging there like the broken wing of a
<hi rend='italic'>vanneau</hi>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He replied good humouredly:</p>

<p>"Thou dost not know the Legion, Marie-Josephine.
Every day in our trenches we
break a comrade into pieces and glue him
together again, just to make him tougher.
Broken bones, once mended, are stronger
than before."</p>

<p>He was looking down at her where she sat
by the hearth, slicing vegetables and herbs,
but watching him all the while out of her
lovely, faded eyes.</p>

<pb n='72'/><anchor id='Pg72'/>
<p>"I understand, Monsieur Jacques, that you
are like your father&mdash;God knows he was
hardy and without fear&mdash;to the last"&mdash;she
dropped her head&mdash;"Mary, glorious&mdash;intercede&mdash;"
she muttered over her bowl of herbs.</p>

<p>Wayland, resting on his crutches, unslung
his ducks, laid them on the table, smoothed
their beautiful heads and breasts, then
slipped the soaking <hi rend='italic'>bandouli&egrave;re</hi> of his gun
from his shoulder and placed the dripping
piece against the chimney corner.</p>

<p>"After I have scrubbed myself," he said,
"and have put on dry clothes, I shall come to
luncheon; and I shall have something very
strange to tell you, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>He limped away into one of the two remaining
rooms&mdash;the other was hers&mdash;and
closed his door.</p>

<p>Marie-Josephine continued to prepare the
soup. There was an egg for him, too; and
a slice of cold pork and a <hi rend='italic'>brioche</hi> and a jug
of cider.</p>

<p>In his room Wayland was whistling "Tipperary."</p>

<p>Now and again, pausing in her work, she<pb n='73'/><anchor id='Pg73'/>
turned her eyes to his closed door&mdash;wonderful
eyes that became miracles of tenderness
as she listened.</p>

<p>He came out, presently, dressed in his odd,
ill-fitting uniform of the Legion, tunic unbuttoned,
collarless of shirt, his bright, thick
hair, now of decent length, in boyish disorder.</p>

<p>Delicious odours of soup and of Breton
cider greeted him; he seated himself; Marie-Josephine
waited on him, hovered over him,
tucked a sack of feathers under his maimed
leg, placed his crutches in the corner beside
the gun.</p>

<p>Still eating, leisurely, he began:</p>

<p>"Marie-Josephine&mdash;a strange thing has
happened on Quesnel Moors which troubles
me.... Listen attentively. It was while
waiting for ducks on the Eryx Rocks, that
once I thought I heard through the roar of
wind and sea the sound of a far cannonading.
But I said to myself that it was only
the imagination of a haunted mind; that in
my ears still thundered the cannonade of
Lens."</p>

<pb n='74'/><anchor id='Pg74'/>
<p>"Was it nevertheless true?" She had
turned around from the fire where her own
soup simmered in the kettle. As she spoke
again she rose and came to the table.</p>

<p>He said: "It must have been cannon that
I heard. Because, not long afterward, out
of the fog came a great a&euml;roplane rushing
inland from the sea&mdash;flying swiftly above me&mdash;right
over me!&mdash;and staggering like a
wounded duck&mdash;it had one aileron broken&mdash;and
sheered away into the fog, northward,
Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>Her work-worn hands, tightly clenched,
rested now on the table and she leaned there,
looking down at him.</p>

<p>"Was it an enemy&mdash;this airship, Jacques?"</p>

<p>"In the mist flying and the ragged clouds
I could not tell. It might have been English.
It must have been, I think&mdash;coming as
it came from the sea. But I am troubled,
Marie-Josephine. Were the guns at sea an
enemy's guns? Did the a&euml;roplane come to
earth in safety? Where? In the Forest of
La&iuml;s? I found no trace of it."</p>

<pb n='75'/><anchor id='Pg75'/>
<p>She said, tremulous perhaps from standing
too long motionless and intent:</p>

<p>"Is it possible that the Boches would come
into these solitary moors, where there are
no people any more, only the creatures of the
La&iuml;s woods, and the curlew and the lapwings
which pass at evening?"</p>

<p>He ate thoughtfully and in silence for a
while; then:</p>

<p>"They go, usually&mdash;the Boches&mdash;where
there is plunder&mdash;murder to be done....
Spying to be done.... God knows what purpose
animates the Huns.... After all, Lorient
is not so far away.... Yet it surely
must have been an English a&euml;roplane, beaten
off by some enemy ship&mdash;a submarine perhaps.
God send that the rocks of the Isle
des Chouans take care of her&mdash;with their
teeth!"</p>

<p>He drank his cider&mdash;a sip or two only&mdash;then,
setting aside the glass:</p>

<p>"I went from the Rocks of Eryx to La&iuml;s
Woods. I called as loudly as I could; the
wind whirled my voice back into my throat....
I am not yet very strong....</p>

<pb n='76'/><anchor id='Pg76'/>
<p>"Then I went into the wood as far as my
strength permitted. I heard and saw nothing,
Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>"Would they be dead?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They were planing to earth. I don't know
how much control they had, whether they
could steer&mdash;choose a landing place. There
are plenty of safe places on these moors."</p>

<p>"If their airship is crippled, what can they
do, these English flying men, out there on
the moors in the rain and wind? When the
coast guard passes we must tell him."</p>

<p>"After lunch I shall go out again as far
as my strength allows.... If the rain would
cease and the mist lift, one might see something&mdash;be
of some use, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ought you to go, Monsieur Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Could I fail to try to find them&mdash;Englishmen&mdash;and
perhaps injured? Surely I should
go, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>"The coast guard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He passed the Eryx Rocks at daylight.
He is at Sainte-Ylva now. Tonight, when
I see his comrade's lantern, I shall stop him<pb n='77'/><anchor id='Pg77'/>
and report. But in the meanwhile I must go
out and search."</p>

<p>"Spare thyself&mdash;for the trenches, Jacques.
Remain indoors today." She began to unpin
the coiffe which she always wore ceremoniously
at meals when he was present.</p>

<p>He smiled: "Thou knowest I must go,
Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>"And if thou come upon them in the forest
and they are Huns?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "They are English, I tell thee,
Marie-Josephine!"</p>

<p>She nodded; under her breath, staring at
the rain-lashed window: "Like thy father,
thou must go forth," she muttered; "go always
where thy spirit calls. And once <hi rend='italic'>he</hi>
went. And came no more. And God help
us all in Finist&egrave;re, where all are born to
grief."</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII<lb/><lb/>
THE AIRMAN</head>

<p>She had seated herself on a stool by the
hearth. Presently she spread her apron with
trembling fingers, took the glazed bowl of
soup upon her lap and began to eat, slowly,
casting long, unquiet glances at him from
time to time where he still at table leaned
heavily, looking out into the rain.</p>

<p>When he caught her eye he smiled, summoning
her with a nod of his boyish head.
She set aside her bowl obediently, and, rising,
brought him his crutches. And at the same
moment somebody knocked lightly on the
outer door.</p>

<p>Marie-Josephine had unpinned her coiffe.
Now she pinned it on over her <hi rend='italic'>bonnet</hi> before
going to the door, glancing uneasily around
at him while she tied her tresses and settled<pb n='79'/><anchor id='Pg79'/>
the delicate starched wings of her bonnet.</p>

<p>"That's odd," he said, "that knocking,"
staring at the door. "Perhaps it is the lost
Englishman."</p>

<p>"God send them," she whispered, going to
the door and opening it.</p>

<p>It certainly seemed to be one of the lost
Englishmen&mdash;a big, square-shouldered, blond
young fellow, tall and powerful, in the leather
dress of an a&euml;ronaut. His glass mask was
lifted like the visor of a tilting helmet,
disclosing a red, weather-beaten face, wet
with rain. Strength, youth, rugged health
was their first impression of this leather-clad
man from the clouds.</p>

<p>He stepped inside the house immediately,
halted when he caught sight of Wayland in
his undress uniform, glanced involuntarily at
his crutches and bandaged leg, cast a quick,
penetrating glance right and left; then he
spoke pleasantly in his hesitating, imperfect
French&mdash;so oddly imperfect that Wayland
could not understand him at all.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded in English.</p>

<p>The airman seemed astonished for an in<pb n='80'/><anchor id='Pg80'/>stant,
then a quick smile broke out on his
ruddy features:</p>

<p>"I say, this <hi rend='italic'>is</hi> lucky! Fancy finding an
Englishman here!&mdash;wherever this place may
be." He laughed. "Of course I know I'm
'somewhere in France,' as the censor has it,
but I'm hanged if I know where!"</p>

<p>"Come in and shut the door," said Wayland,
reassured. Marie-Josephine closed the
door. The a&euml;ronaut came forward, stood
dripping a moment, then took the chair to
which Wayland pointed, seating himself as
though a trifle tired.</p>

<p>"Shot down," he explained, gaily. "An
enemy submarine winged us out yonder somewhere.
I tramped over these bally moors
for hours before I found a sign of any path.
A sheepwalk brought me here."</p>

<p>"You are lucky. There is only one house
on these moors&mdash;this! Who are you?" asked
Wayland.</p>

<p>"West&mdash;flight-lieutenant, 10th division, Cinque-Ports
patrolling squadron."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, man! What are you doing
in Finist&egrave;re?"</p>

<pb n='81'/><anchor id='Pg81'/>
<p>"<hi rend='italic'>What!</hi>"</p>

<p>"You are in Brittany, province of Finist&egrave;re.
Didn't you know it?"</p>

<p>The air-officer seemed astounded. Presently
he said: "The dirty weather foxed us.
Then that fellow out yonder winged us. I
was glad enough to see a coast line."</p>

<p>"Did you fall?"</p>

<p>"No; we controlled our landing pretty
well."</p>

<p>"Where did you land?"</p>

<p>There was a second's hesitation; the airman
looked at Wayland, glanced at his crippled
leg.</p>

<p>"Out there near some woods," he said.
"My pilot's there now trying to patch up....
You are not French, are you?"</p>

<p>"American."</p>

<p>"Oh! A&mdash;volunteer, I presume."</p>

<p>"Foreign Legion&mdash;2d."</p>

<p>"I see. Back from the trenches with a
leg."</p>

<p>"It's nearly well. I'll be back soon."</p>

<p>"Can you walk?" asked the airman so<pb n='82'/><anchor id='Pg82'/>
abruptly that Wayland, looking at him, hesitated,
he did not quite know why.</p>

<p>"Not very far," he replied, cautiously. "I
can get to the window with my crutches
pretty well."</p>

<p>And the next moment he felt ashamed of
his caution when the airman laughed frankly.</p>

<p>"I need a guide to some petrol," he said.
"Evidently you can't go with me."</p>

<p>"Haven't you enough petrol to take you to
Lorient?"</p>

<p>"How far is Lorient?"</p>

<p>Wayland told him.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the flight-lieutenant;
"I'll have to try to get somewhere. I suppose
it is useless for me to ask," he added,
"but have you, by any chance, a bit of canvas&mdash;an
old sail or hammock?&mdash;I don't need
much. That's what I came for&mdash;and some
shellac and wire, and a screwdriver of sorts?
We need patching as well as petrol; and
we're a little short of supplies."</p>

<p>Wayland's steady gaze never left him, but
his smile was friendly.</p>

<p>"We're in a tearing hurry, too," added the<pb n='83'/><anchor id='Pg83'/>
flight-lieutenant, looking out of the window.</p>

<p>Wayland smiled. "Of course there's no
petrol here. There's nothing here. I don't
suppose you could have landed in a more
deserted region if you had tried. There's a
ch&acirc;teau in the La&iuml;s woods, but it's closed;
owner and servants are at the war and the
family in Paris."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Everybody
has cleared out; the war has stripped the
country; and there never were any people
on these moors, excepting shooting parties
and, in the summer, a stray artist or two
from Quimperl&eacute;."</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked at him. "You say
there is nobody here&mdash;between here and
Lorient? No&mdash;troops?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to guard. The coast is
one vast shoal. Ships pass hull down. Once a
day a coast guard patrols along the cliffs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"He has passed, unfortunately. Otherwise
he might signal by relay to Lorient and have
them send you out some petrol. By the way&mdash;are
you hungry?"</p>

<pb n='84'/><anchor id='Pg84'/>
<p>The flight-lieutenant showed all his firm,
white teeth under a yellow mustache, which
curled somewhat upward. He laughed in a
carefree way, as though something had suddenly
eased his mind of perplexity&mdash;perhaps
the certainty that there was no possible
chance for petrol. Certainty is said to be
more endurable than suspense.</p>

<p>"I'll stop for a bite&mdash;if you don't mind&mdash;while
my pilot tinkers out yonder," he said.
"We're not in such a bad way. It might
easily have been worse. Do you think you
could find us a bit of sail, or something, to
use for patching?"</p>

<p>Wayland indicated an old high-backed chair
of oak, quaintly embellished with ancient
leather in faded blue and gold. It had been
a royal chair in its day, or the Fleur-de-Lys
lied.</p>

<p>The flight-lieutenant seated himself with a
rather stiff bow.</p>

<p>"If you need canvas"&mdash;Wayland hesitated&mdash;then,
gravely: "There are, in my room, a
number of artists' <hi rend='italic'>toiles</hi>&mdash;old chassis with
the blank canvas still untouched."</p>

<pb n='85'/><anchor id='Pg85'/>
<p>"Exactly what we need!" exclaimed the
other. "What luck, now, to meet a painter
in such a place as this!"</p>

<p>"They belonged to my father," explained
Wayland. "We&mdash;Marie-Josephine and I&mdash;have
always kept my father's old canvases
and colours&mdash;everything of his.... I'll be
glad to give them to a British soldier....
They're about all I have that was his&mdash;except
that oak chair you sit on."</p>

<p>He rose on his crutches, spoke briefly in
Breton to Marie-Josephine, then limped
slowly away to his room.</p>

<p>When he returned with half a dozen blank
canvases the flight-lieutenant, at table, was
eating pork and black bread and drinking
Breton cider.</p>

<p>Wayland seated himself, laid both crutches
across his knees, picked up one of the chassis,
and began to rip from it the dusty canvas.
It was like tearing muscles from his own
bones. But he smiled and chatted on, casually,
with the air-officer, who ate as though
half starved.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Wayland, "you'll start<pb n='86'/><anchor id='Pg86'/>
back across the Channel as soon as you secure
petrol enough?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"You could go by way of Quimper or by
Lorient. There's petrol to be had at both
places for military purposes"&mdash;leisurely continuing
to rip the big squares of canvas from
the frames.</p>

<p>The airman, still eating, watched him
askance at intervals.</p>

<p>"I've brought what's left of the shellac;
it isn't much use, I fear. But here is his
hammer and canvas stretcher, and the remainder
of the nails he used for stretching
his canvases," said Wayland, with an effort
to speak carelessly.</p>

<p>"Many thanks. You also are a painter, I
take it."</p>

<p>Wayland laid one hand on the sleeve of
his uniform and laughed.</p>

<p>"I <hi rend='italic'>was</hi> a writer. But there are only soldiers
in the world now."</p>

<p>"Quite so ... This is an odd place for an
American to live in."</p>

<p>"My father bought it years ago. He was<pb n='87'/><anchor id='Pg87'/>
a painter of peasant life." He added, lowering
his voice, although Marie-Josephine understood
no English: "This old peasant
woman was his model many years ago. She
also kept house for him. He lived here; I
was born here."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but my father desired that I grow
up a good Yankee. I was at school in America
when he&mdash;died."</p>

<p>The airman continued to eat very busily.</p>

<p>"He died&mdash;out there"&mdash;Wayland looked
through the window, musingly. "There was
an Iceland schooner wrecked off the Isle des
Chouans. And no life-saving crew short of
Ylva Light. So my father went out in his
little American catboat, all alone.... Marie-Josephine
saw his sail off Eryx Rocks ... for
a few moments ... and saw it no more."</p>

<p>The airman, still devouring his bread and
meat, nodded in silence.</p>

<p>"That is how it happened," said Wayland.
"The French authorities notified me. There
was a little money and this hut, and&mdash;Marie-Josephine.
So I came here; and I write<pb n='88'/><anchor id='Pg88'/>
children's stories&mdash;that sort of thing....
It goes well enough. I sell a few to American
publishers. Otherwise I shoot and fish
and read ... when war does not preoccupy
me...."</p>

<p>He smiled, experiencing the vague relief of
talking to somebody in his native tongue.
Quesnel Moors were sometimes very lonely.</p>

<p>"It's been a long convalescence," he continued,
smilingly. "One of their 'coal-boxes'
did this"&mdash;touching his leg. "When I was
able to move I went to America. But the sea
off the Eryx called me back; and the authorities
permitted me to come down here. I'm
getting well very fast now."</p>

<p>He had stripped every chassis of its canvas,
and had made a roll of the material.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to be of any use to you,"
he said pleasantly, laying the roll on the
table.</p>

<p>Marie-Josephine, on her low chair by the
hearth, sat listening to every word as though
she had understood. The expression in her
faded eyes varied constantly; solicitude, perplexity,
vague uneasiness, a recurrent glim<pb n='89'/><anchor id='Pg89'/>mer
of suspicion were succeeded always by
wistful tenderness when her gaze returned to
Wayland and rested on his youthful face and
figure with a pride forever new.</p>

<p>Once she spoke in mixed French and
Breton:</p>

<!-- FIXME: italics around corrections for TXT -->
<pgIf output='txt'>
  <then>

<p>"Is the stranger English, Monsieur Jacques,
<hi rend='italic'>mon ch&eacute;ri</hi>?"</p>
  </then>
  <else>
<p>"Is the stranger English, Monsieur Jacques,
<hi rend='italic'>mon <corr sic='cheri'>ch&eacute;ri</corr></hi>?"</p>
  </else>

</pgIf>


<p>"I do not doubt it, Marie-Josephine. Do
you?"</p>

<p>"Why dost thou believe him to be English?"</p>

<p>"He has the tricks of speech. Also his
accent is of an English university. There
is no mistaking it."</p>

<p>"Are not young Huns sometimes instructed
in the universities of England?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Gar &agrave; nous, mon p'tit</hi>, Jacques. In Finist&egrave;re
a stranger is a suspect. Since earliest
times they have done us harm in Finist&egrave;re.
The strangers&mdash;God knows what centuries of
evil they have wrought."</p>

<p>"No fear," he said, reassuringly, and turned
again to the airman, who had now satisfied<pb n='90'/><anchor id='Pg90'/>
his hunger and had already risen to gather
up the roll of canvas, the hammer, nails, and
shellac.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, old chap!" he said cordially.
"I'll take these articles, if I may.
It's very good of you ... I'm in a tearing
hurry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won't your pilot come over and eat a
bit?"</p>

<p>"I'll take him this bread and meat, if I
may. Many thanks." He held out his heavily
gloved hand with a friendly smile, nodded
to Marie-Josephine. And as he hurriedly
turned to go, the ancient carving on the high-backed
chair caught him between the buttons
of his leather coat, tearing it wide open over
the breast. And Wayland saw the ribbon
of the Iron Cross there fastened to a sea-grey
tunic.</p>

<p>There was a second's frightful silence.</p>

<p>"What's that you wear?" said Wayland
hoarsely. "Stop! Stand where you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Halt! Don't touch that shotgun!" cried
the airman sharply. But Wayland already
had it in his hands, and the airman fired twice<pb n='91'/><anchor id='Pg91'/>
at him where he stood&mdash;steadied the automatic
to shoot again, but held his fire, seeing
it would not be necessary. Besides, he did
not care to shoot the old woman unless military
precaution made it advisable; and she
was on her knees, her withered arms upflung,
shielding the prostrate body with her own.</p>

<p>"You Yankee fool," he snapped out
harshly&mdash;"it is your own fault, not mine!...
Like the rest of your imbecile nation
you poke your nose where it has no business!
And I&mdash;" He ceased speaking, realizing that
his words remained unheard.</p>

<p>After a moment he backed toward the
door, carrying the canvas roll under his left
arm and keeping his eye carefully on the
prostrate man. Also, one can never trust
the French!&mdash;he was quite ready for that
old woman there on the floor who was holding
the dead boy's head to her breast, muttering:
"My darling! My child!&mdash;Oh, little
son of Marie-Josephine!&mdash;I told thee&mdash;I
warned thee of the stranger in Finist&egrave;re!...
Marie&mdash;holy&mdash;intercede!... All&mdash;all are
born to grief in Finist&egrave;re!..."</p>

<p>The incredible rumour that German airmen
were in Brittany first came from Plouharnel
in Morbihan; then from Bannalec,
where an old Icelander had notified the
Brigadier of the local Gendarmerie. But the
Icelander was very drunk. A thimble of
cognac did it.</p>

<p>Again came an unconfirmed report that a
shepherd lad while alternately playing on his
Biniou and fishing for eels at the confluence
of the Elle and Isole, had seen a werewolf
in La&iuml;s Woods. The Loup Garou walked on
two legs and had assumed the shape of a
man with no features except two enormous
eyes.</p>

<p>The following week a coast guard near
Flouranges telephoned to the Aulnes Light<pb n='93'/><anchor id='Pg93'/>house;
the keeper of the light telephoned to
Lorient the story of Wayland, and was instructed
to extinguish the great flash again
and to keep watch from the lantern until an
investigation could be made.</p>

<p>That an enemy airman had done murder
in Finist&egrave;re was now certain; but that a
Boche submarine had come into the Bay of
Biscay seemed very improbable, considering
the measures which had been taken in the
Channel, at Trieste, and at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>That a fleet of many sea-planes was soaring
somewhere between the Isle des Chouettes
and Finist&egrave;re, and landing men, seemed
to be practically an impossibility. Yet, there
were the rumours. And murder had been
done.</p>

<p>But an enemy undersea boat required a
base. Had such a base been established
somewhere along those lonely and desolate
wastes of bog and rock and moor and gorse-set
cliff haunted only by curlew and wild
duck, and bounded inland by a silent barrier
of forest through which the wild boar roamed
and rooted unmolested?</p>

<pb n='94'/><anchor id='Pg94'/>

<p>And where in Finist&egrave;re was an enemy seaplane
to come from, when, save for the few
remaining submarines still skulking near
British waters, the enemy's flag had vanished
from the seas?</p>

<p>Nevertheless the coast lights at Aulnes and
on the Isle des Chouettes went out; the Commandant
at Lorient and the General in command
of the British expeditionary troops in
the harbour consulted; and the fleet of troop-laden
transports did not sail as scheduled,
but a swarm of French and British cruisers,
trawlers, mine-sweepers, destroyers, and submarines
put out from the great warport to
comb the boisterous seas of Biscay for any
possible a&euml;rial or amphibious Hun who might
venture to haunt the coasts.</p>

<p>Inland, too, officers were sent hither and
thither to investigate various rumours and
doubtful reports at their several sources.</p>

<p>And it happened in that way that Captain
Neeland of the 6th Battalion, Athabasca
Regiment, Canadian Overseas Contingent,
found himself in the Forest of Aulnes, with
instructions to stay there long enough to<pb n='95'/><anchor id='Pg95'/>
verify or discredit a disturbing report which
had just arrived by mail.</p>

<p>The report was so strange and the investigation
required so much secrecy and caution
that Captain Neeland changed his uniform
for knickerbockers and shooting coat, borrowed
a fowling piece and a sack of cartridges
loaded with No. 4 shot, tucked his gun
under his arm, and sauntered out of Lorient
town before dawn, like any other duck-hunting
enthusiast.</p>

<p>Several reasons influenced his superiors in
sending Neeland to investigate this latest and
oddest report: for one thing, although he had
become temporarily a Canadian for military
purposes only, in reality he was an American
artist who, like scores and scores of his
artistic fellow Yankees, had spent many
years industriously painting those sentimental
Breton scenes which obsess our painters, if
not their critics. He was a very bad painter,
but he did not know it; he had already become
a promising soldier, but he did not
realize that either. As a sportsman, however,
Neeland was rather pleased with himself.</p>

<pb n='96'/><anchor id='Pg96'/>
<p>He was sent because he knew the sombre
and lovely land of Finist&egrave;re pretty well, because
he was more or less of a naturalist and
a sportsman, and because the plan which he
had immediately proposed appeared to be
reasonable as well as original.</p>

<p>It had been a stiff walk across country&mdash;fifteen
miles, as against thirty odd around
by road&mdash;but neither cart nor motor was to
enter into the affair. If anybody should
watch him, he was only a duckhunter afield,
crossing the marshes, skirting <hi rend='italic'>&eacute;tangs</hi>, a solitary
figure in the waste, easily reconcilable
with his wide and melancholy surroundings.</p>

L'OMBRE</head>

<p>Aulnes Woods were brown and still under
their unshed canopy of October leaves.
Against a grey, transparent sky the oaks
and beeches towered, unstirred by any wind;
in the subdued light among the trees, ferns,
startlingly green, spread delicate plumed
fronds; there was no sound except the soft
crash of his own footsteps through shriveling
patches of brake; no movement save
when a yellow leaf fluttered down from above
or one of those little silvery grey moths took
wing and fluttered aimlessly along the forest
aisle, only to alight upon some lichen-spotted
tree and cling there, slowly waving its delicate,
translucent wings.</p>

<p>It was a very ancient wood, the Forest of
Aulnes, and the old trees were long past<pb n='98'/><anchor id='Pg98'/>
timber value. Even those gleaners of dead
wood and fallen branches seemed to have
passed a different way, for the forest floor
was littered with material that seldom goes
to waste in Europe, and which broke under
foot with a dull, thick sound, filling the nostrils
with the acrid odour of decay.</p>

<p>Narrow paths full of dead leaves ran here
and there through the woods, but he took
none of these, keeping straight on toward the
northwest until a high, moss-grown wall
checked his progress.</p>

<p>It ran west through the silent forest; damp
green mould and lichens stained it; patches
of grey stucco had peeled from it, revealing
underneath the roughly dressed stones. He
followed the wall.</p>

<p>Now and then, far in the forest, and indistinctly,
he heard faint sounds&mdash;perhaps the
cautious tread of roebuck, or rabbits in the
bracken, or the patter of a stoat over dry
leaves; perhaps the sullen retirement of some
wild boar, winding man in the depths of his
own domain, and sulkily conceding him right
of way.</p>

<pb n='99'/><anchor id='Pg99'/>
<p>After a while there came a break in the
wall where four great posts of stone stood,
and where there should have been gates.</p>

<p>But only the ancient and rusting hinges
remained of either gate or wicket.</p>

<p>He looked up at the carved escutcheons;
the moss of many centuries had softened and
smothered the sculptured device, so that its
form had become indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Inside stood a stone lodge. Tiles had
fallen from the ancient roof; leaded panes
were broken; nobody came to the closed and
discoloured door of massive oak.</p>

<p>The avenue, which was merely an unkempt,
overgrown ride, curved away between the
great gateposts into the woods; and, as he
entered it, three deer left stealthily, making
no sound in the forest.</p>

<p>Nobody was to be seen, neither gatekeeper
nor woodchopper nor charcoal burner. Nothing
moved amid the trees except a tiny, silent
bird belated in his autumn migration.</p>

<p>The ride curved to the east; and abruptly
he came into view of the house&mdash;a low,<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>
weather-ravaged structure in the grassy
glade, ringed by a square, wet moat.</p>

<p>There was no terrace; the ride crossed a
permanent bridge of stone, passed the carved
and massive entrance, crossed a second
crumbling causeway, and continued on into
the forest.</p>

<p>An old Breton woman, who was drawing
a jug of water from the moat, turned and
looked at Neeland, and then went silently
into the house.</p>

<p>A moment later a younger woman appeared
on the doorstep and stood watching his approach.</p>

<p>As he crossed the bridge he took off his
cap.</p>

<p>"Madame, the Countess of Aulnes?" he inquired.
"Would you be kind enough to say
to her that I arrive from Lorient at her
request?"</p>

<p>"I am the Countess of Aulnes," she said
in flawless English.</p>

<p>He bowed again. "I am Captain Neeland
of the British Expeditionary force."</p>

<p>"May I see your credentials, Captain Nee<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>land?"
She had descended the single step of
crumbling stone.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Countess; may I first be certain
concerning <hi rend='italic'>your</hi> identity?"</p>

<p>There was a silence. To Neeland she
seemed very young in her black gown. Perhaps
it was that sombre setting and her dark
eyes and hair which made her skin seem so
white.</p>

<p>"What proof of my identity do you expect?"
she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Only one word, Madame."</p>

<p>She moved a step nearer, bent a trifle
toward him. "L'Ombre," she whispered.</p>

<p>From his pocket he drew his credentials
and offered them. Among them was her own
letter to the authorities at Lorient.</p>

<p>After she had examined them she handed
them back to him.</p>

<p>"Will you come in, Captain Neeland&mdash;or,
perhaps we had better seat ourselves on the
bridge&mdash;in order to lose no time&mdash;because I
wish you to see for yourself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lifted her dark eyes; a tint of embarrassment
came into her cheeks: "It may seem<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
absurd to you; it seems so to me, at times&mdash;what
I am going to say to you&mdash;concerning
L'Ombre&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had turned; he followed; and at her
grave gesture of invitation, he seated himself
beside her on the coping of mossy stone
which ran like a bench under the parapet of
the little bridge.</p>

<p>"Captain Neeland," she said, "I am a Bretonne,
but, until recently, I did not suppose
myself to be superstitious.... I really am
not&mdash;unless&mdash;except for this one matter of
L'Ombre.... My English governess drove
superstition out of my head.... Still, living
in Finist&egrave;re&mdash;here in this house"&mdash;she flushed
again&mdash;"I shall have to leave it to you....
I dread ridicule; but I am sure you are too
courteous&mdash;... It required some courage
for me to write to Lorient. But, if it might
possibly help my country&mdash;to risk ridicule&mdash;of
course I do not hesitate."</p>

<p>She looked uncertainly at the young man's
pleasant, serious face, and, as though reassured:</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell you a little about<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>
myself first&mdash;so that you may understand
better."</p>

<p>"Please," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;my father and my only brother
died a year ago, in battle.... It happened
in the Argonne.... I am alone. We had
maintained only two men servants here.
They went with their classes. One old
woman remains." She looked up with a
forced smile. "I need not explain to you
that our circumstances are much straitened.
You have only to look about you to see that ... our
poverty is not recent; it always has
been so within my memory&mdash;only growing a
little worse every year. I believe our misfortunes
began during the Vend&eacute;e.... But
that is of no interest ... except that&mdash;through
coincidence, of course&mdash;every time a
new misfortune comes upon our family, misfortune
also falls on France." He nodded,
still mystified, but interested.</p>

<p>"Did you happen to notice the device
carved on the gatepost?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I thought it resembled a fish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>
<p>"Do you understand French, Captain Neeland?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you know that L'Ombre means 'the
shadow'."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you know, also, that there is a fish
called 'L'Ombre'?"</p>

<p>"No; I did not know that."</p>

<p>"There is. It looks like a shadow in the
water. L'Ombre does not belong here in Brittany.
It is a northern fish of high altitudes
where waters are icy and rapid and always
tinctured with melted snow ... would you accord
me a little more patience, Monsieur, if
I seem to be garrulous concerning my own
family? It is merely because I want you to
understand everything ... <hi rend='italic'>everything</hi>...."</p>

<p>"I am interested," he assured her pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;it is a legend&mdash;perhaps a superstition
in our family&mdash;that any misfortune to
us&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>and to France</hi>&mdash;is always preceded by two
invariable omens. One of these dreaded signs
is the abrupt appearance of L'Ombre in the<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>
waters of our moat&mdash;" She turned her head
slowly and looked down over the parapet of
the bridge.&mdash;"The other omen," she continued
quietly, "is that the clocks in our house
suddenly go wrong&mdash;all striking the same
hour, no matter where the hands point, no
matter what time it really is.... These
things have always happened in our family,
they say. I, myself, have never before witnessed
them. But during the Vend&eacute;e the
clocks persisted in striking four times every
hour. The Comte d'Aulnes mounted the scaffold
at that hour; the Vicomte died under
Charette at Fontenay at that hour.... L'Ombre
appeared in the waters of the moat at
four o'clock one afternoon. And then the
clocks went wrong.</p>

<p>"And all this happened again, they say, in
1870. L'Ombre appeared in the moat. Every
clock continued to strike six, day after day
for a whole week, until the battle of Sedan
ended.... My grandfather died there with
the light cavalry.... I am so afraid I am
taxing your courtesy, Captain Neeland&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am intensely interested," he repeated,<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>
watching the lovely, sensitive face which pride
and dread of misinterpretation had slightly
flushed again.</p>

<p>"It is only to explain&mdash;perhaps to justify
myself for writing&mdash;for asking that an officer
be sent here from Lorient for a few days&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand, Countess."</p>

<p>"Thank you.... Had it been merely for
myself&mdash;for my own fears&mdash;my personal safety,
I should not have written. But our misfortunes
seem to be coincident with my country's
mishaps.... So I thought&mdash;if they
sent an officer who would be kind enough to
understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand ... L'Ombre has appeared in
the moat again, has it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it came a week ago, suddenly, at
five o'clock in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the clocks?"</p>

<p>"For a week they have been all wrong."</p>

<p>"What hour do they strike?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Five."</p>

<p>"No matter where the hands point?"</p>

<p>"No matter. I have tried to regulate them.<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>
I have done everything I could do. But they
continue to strike five every hour of the day
and night.... I have"&mdash;a pale smile touched
her lips&mdash;"I have been a little wakeful&mdash;perhaps
a trifle uneasy&mdash;on my country's account.
You understand...." Pride and courage had
permitted her no more than uneasiness, it
seemed. Or if fear had threatened her there
in her lonely bedroom through the still watches
of the night, she desired him to understand
that her solicitude was for France, not for
any daughter of the race whose name she
bore.</p>

<p>The simplicity and directness of her amazing
narrative had held his respect and attention;
there could be no doubt that she implicitly
believed what she told him.</p>

<p>But that was one thing; and the wild extravagance
of the story was another. There
must be, of course, an explanation for these
phenomena other than a supernatural one.
Such things do not happen except in medieval
romance and tales of sorcery and doom. And
of all regions on earth Brittany swarms with
such tales and superstitions. He knew it.<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
And this young girl was Bretonne after all,
however educated, however accomplished, however
honest and modern and sincere. And
he began to comprehend that the germs of
superstition and credulity were in the blood
of every Breton ever born.</p>

<p>But he merely said with pleasant deference:
"I can very easily understand your uneasiness
and perplexity, Madame. It is a time
of mental stress, of great nervous tension in
France&mdash;of heart-racking suspense&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lifted her dark eyes. "You do not believe
me, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"I believe what you have told me. But I
believe, also, that there is a natural explanation
concerning these matters."</p>

<p>"I tell myself so, too.... But I brood over
them in vain; I can find no explanation."</p>

<p>"Of course there must be one," he insisted
carelessly. "Is there anything in the world
more likely to go queer than a clock?"</p>

<p>"There are five clocks in the house. Why
should they all go wrong at the same time and
in the same manner?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "I don't know," he said frankly.<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>
"I'll investigate, if you will permit me."</p>

<p>"Of course.... And, about L'Ombre. What
could explain its presence in the moat? It is
a creature of icy waters; it is extremely limited
in its range. My father has often said
that, except L'Ombre which has appeared at
long intervals in our moat, L'Ombre never has
been seen in Brittany."</p>

<p>"From where does this clear water come
which fills the moat?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"From living springs in the bottom."</p>

<p>"No doubt," he said cheerfully, "a long
subterranean vein of water connects these
springs with some distant Alpine river, somewhere&mdash;in
the Pyrenees, perhaps&mdash;" He hesitated,
for the explanation seemed as far-fetched
as the water.</p>

<p>Perhaps it so appeared to her, for she remained
politely silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the house, a clock struck five
times. They both sat listening intently. From
the depths of the ancient mansion, the other
clocks repeated the strokes, first one, then
another, then two sounding their clear little
bells almost in unison. All struck five. He<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
drew out his watch and looked at it. The
hour was three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>After a moment her attitude, a trifle rigid,
relaxed. He muttered something about making
an examination of the clocks, adding that
to adjust and regulate them would be a simple
matter.</p>

<p>She sat very still beside him on the stone
coping&mdash;her dark eyes wandered toward the
forest&mdash;wonderful eyes, dreamily preoccupied&mdash;the
visionary eyes of a Bretonne, full of the
mystery and beauty of magic things unseen.</p>

<p>Venturing, at last, to disturb the delicate sequence
of her thoughts: "Madame," he said,
"have you heard any rumours concerning enemy
airships&mdash;or, undersea boats?"</p>

<p>The tranquil gaze returned, rested on him:
"No, but something has been happening in
the Aulnes <corr sic='Etang'>&Eacute;tang</corr>."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But every day the wild
ducks rise from it in fright&mdash;clouds of them&mdash;and
the curlew and lapwings fill the sky with
their clamour."</p>

<p>"A poacher?"</p>

<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
<p>"I know of none remaining here in Finist&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything in the sky? An
eagle?"</p>

<p>"Only the wild fowl whirling above the
<hi rend='italic'>&eacute;tang</hi>."</p>

<p>"You have heard nothing&mdash;from the
clouds?"</p>

<p>"Only the <hi rend='italic'>vanneaux</hi> complaining and the
wild curlew answering."</p>

<p>"Where is L'Ombre?" he asked, vaguely
troubled.</p>

<p>She rose; he followed her across the bridge
and along the mossy border of the moat.
Presently she stood still and pointed down in
silence.</p>

<p>For a while he saw nothing in the moat;
then, suspended midway between surface and
bottom, motionless in the transparent water, a
shadow, hanging there, colourless, translucent&mdash;a
phantom vaguely detached from the limpid
element through which it loomed.</p>

<p>L'Ombre lay very still in the silvery-grey
depths where the glass of the stream reflected
the fa&ccedil;ade of that ancient house.</p>

<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
<p>Around the angle of the moat crept a ripple;
a rat appeared, swimming, and, seeing
them, dived. L'Ombre never stirred.</p>

<p>An involuntary shudder passed over Neeland,
and he looked up abruptly with the instinct
of a creature suddenly trapped&mdash;but not
yet quite realizing it.</p>

<p>In the grey forest walling that silent place,
in the monotonous sky overhead, there seemed
something indefinitely menacing; a menace, too,
in the intense stillness; and, in the twisted,
uplifted limbs of every giant tree, a subtle
and suspended threat.</p>

<p>He said tritely and with an effort: "For
everything there are natural causes. These
may always be discovered with ingenuity and
persistence.... Shall we examine your clocks,
Madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Will your General be annoyed
because I have asked that an officer be sent
here? Tell me truthfully, are <hi rend='italic'>you</hi> annoyed?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," he insisted, striving to smile
away the inexplicable sense of depression
which was creeping over him.</p>

<p>He looked down again at the grey wraith<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>
in the water, then, as they turned and walked
slowly back across the bridge together, he
said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Something</hi> is wrong somewhere in Finist&egrave;re.
That is evident to me. There have
been too many rumours from too many sources.
By sea and land they come&mdash;rumours of things
half seen, half heard&mdash;glimpses of enemy aircraft,
sea-craft. Yet their presence would
appear to be an impossibility in the light of
the military intelligence which we possess.</p>

<p>"But we have investigated every rumour;
although I, personally, know of no report
which has been confirmed. Nevertheless, these
rumours persist; they come thicker and faster
day by day. But this&mdash;" He hesitated, then
smiled&mdash;"this seems rather different&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. I realize that I have invited ridicule&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Countess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are too considerate to say so.... And
perhaps I have become nervous&mdash;imagining
things. It might easily be so. Perhaps it
is the sadness of the past year&mdash;the strangeness
of it, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>
<p>She sighed unconsciously.</p>

<p>"It is lonely in the Wood of Aulnes," she
said.</p>

<p>"Indeed it must be very lonely here," he
returned in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes.... Aulnes Wood is&mdash;too remote for
them to send our wounded here for their convalescence.
I offered Aulnes. Then I offered
myself, saying that I was ready to go
anywhere if I might be of use. It seems there
are already too many volunteers. They take
only the trained in hospitals. I am untrained,
and they have no leisure to teach ... nobody
wanted me."</p>

<p>She turned and gazed dreamily at the forest.</p>

<p>"So there is nothing for me to do," she said,
"except to remain here and sew for the hospitals." ... She
looked out thoughtfully across
the fern-grown <hi rend='italic'>carrefour</hi>: "Therefore I sew
all day by the latticed window there&mdash;all day
long, day after day&mdash;and when one is young
and when there is nobody&mdash;nothing to look
at except the curlew flying&mdash;nothing to hear
except the <hi rend='italic'>vanneaux</hi>, and the clocks striking
the hour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
<p>Her voice had altered subtly, but she lifted
her proud little head and smiled, and her tone
grew firm again:</p>

<p>"You see, Monsieur, I am truly becoming
a trifle morbid. It is entirely physical; my
heart is quite undaunted."</p>

<p>"You heart, Madame, is but a part of the
great, undaunted heart of France."</p>

<p>"Yes ... therefore there could be no fear&mdash;no
doubt of God.... Affairs go well with
France, Monsieur?&mdash;may I ask without military
impropriety?"</p>

<p>"France, as always, faces her destiny, Madame.
And her destiny is victory and light."</p>

<p>"Surely ... I knew; only I had heard nothing
for so long.... Thank you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>He said quietly: "The Light shall break.
We must not doubt it, we English. Nor can
you doubt the ultimate end of this vast and
hellish Darkness which has been let loose upon
the world to assail it. You shall live to see
light, Madame&mdash;and I also shall see it&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up at the young man, met his<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
eyes, and looked elsewhere, gravely. A slight
flush lingered on her cheeks.</p>

<p>On the doorstep of the house they paused.
"Is it possible," she asked, "that an enemy
a&euml;roplane could land in the Aulnes &Eacute;tang?&mdash;L'&Eacute;tang
aux Vanneaux?"</p>

<p>"In the &Eacute;tang?" he repeated, a little startled.
"How large is it, this &Eacute;tang aux Vanneaux?"</p>

<p>"It is a lake. It is perhaps a mile long and
three-quarters of a mile across. My old servant,
Anne, had seen the werewolf in the
reeds&mdash;like a man without a face&mdash;and only
two great eyes&mdash;" She forced a pale smile.
"Of course, if it were anything she saw, it
was a real man.... And, airmen dress that
way.... I wondered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stood looking at her absently, worrying
his short mustache.</p>

<p>"One of the rumours we have heard," he
began, "concerns a supposed invasion by a huge
fleet of German battle-planes of enormous dimensions&mdash;a
new biplane type which is steered
from the bridge like an ocean steamer.</p>

<p>"It is supposed to be three or four times
as large as their usual <hi rend='italic'>Albatross</hi> type, with<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
a vast cruising radius, immense capacity for
lifting, and powerful enough to carry a great
weight of armour, equipment, munitions, and
a very large crew.</p>

<p>"And the most disturbing thing about it is
that it is said to be as noiseless as a high-class
automobile."</p>

<p>"Has such an one been seen in Brittany?"</p>

<p>"Such a machine has been reported&mdash;many,
many times&mdash;as though not one but hundreds
were in Finist&egrave;re. And, what is very disquieting
to us&mdash;a report has arrived from a distant
and totally independent source&mdash;from Sweden&mdash;that
air-crafts of this general type have been
secretly built in Germany by the hundreds."</p>

<p>After a moment's silence she stepped into
the house; he followed.</p>

<p>The great, bare, grey rooms were in keeping
with the grey exterior; age had more than
softened and co&ouml;rdinated the ancient furnishings,
it had rendered them colourless, without
accent, making the place empty and monotonous.</p>

<p>Her chair and workbasket stood by a lat<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>ticed
window; she seated herself and took
up her sewing, watching him where he stood
before the fireplace fussing over a little mantel
clock&mdash;a gilt and ebony affair of the consulate,
shaped like a lyre, the pendulum being also the
clock itself and containing the works, bell and
dial.</p>

<p>When he had adjusted it to his satisfaction
he tested it. It still struck five. He continued
to fuss over it for half an hour, testing it at
intervals, but it always struck five times, and
finally he gave up his attempts with a shrug
of annoyance.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>I</hi> can't do anything with it," he admitted,
smiling cheerfully across the room at her; "is
there another clock on this floor?"</p>

<p>She directed him; he went into an adjoining
room where, on the mantel, a modern enamelled
clock was ticking busily. But after a
little while he gave up his tinkering; he could
do nothing with it; the bell persistently struck
five. He returned to where she sat sewing, admitting
failure with a perplexed and uneasy
smile; and she rose and accompanied him<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>
through the house, where he tried, in turn,
every one of the other clocks.</p>

<p>When, at length, he realized that he could
accomplish nothing by altering their striking
mechanism&mdash;that every clock in the house persisted
in striking five times no matter where
the hands were pointing, a sudden, odd, and
inward rage possessed him to hurl the clocks
at the wall and stamp the last vestiges of
mechanism out of them.</p>

<p>As they returned together through the
hushed and dusky house, he caught glimpses
of faded and depressing tapestries; of vast,
tarnished mirrors, through the dim depths of
which their passing figures moved like ghosts;
of rusted stands of arms, and armoured lay
figures where cobwebs clotted the slitted visors
and the frail tatters of ancient faded banners
drooped.</p>

<p>And he understood why any woman might
believe in strange inexplicable things here in
the haunting stillness of this house where splendour
had turned to mould&mdash;where form had become
effaced and colour dimmed; where only<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
the shadowy film of texture still remained,
and where even that was slowly yielding&mdash;under
the attacks of Time's relentless mercenaries,
moth and dust and rust.</p>

THE GHOULS</head>

<p>They dined by the latticed window; two
candles lighted them; old Anne served them&mdash;old
Anne of F&auml;ouette in her wide white
coiffe and collarette, her velvet bodice and her
<hi rend='italic'>chaussons</hi> broidered with the rose.</p>

<p>Always she talked as she moved about with
dish and salver&mdash;garrulous, deaf, and aged,
and perhaps flushed with the gentle afterglow
of that second infancy which comes before
the night.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Ouidame!</hi> It is I, Anne Le Bihan, who tell
you this, my pretty gentleman. I have lived
through eighty years and I have seen life
begin and end in the Woods of Aulnes&mdash;alas!&mdash;in
the Woods and the House of Aulnes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The red wine, Anne," said her mistress,
gently.</p>

<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>
<p>"Madame the Countess is served.... These
grapes grew when I was young, Monsieur&mdash;and
the world was young, too, <hi rend='italic'>mon Capitaine&mdash;h&eacute;las!</hi>&mdash;but
the Woods of Aulnes were
old, old as the headland yonder. Only the
sea is older, <hi rend='italic'>beau jeune homme</hi>&mdash;only the sea
is older&mdash;the sea which always was and will
be."</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, turning toward the
young girl beside him, "&mdash;to France!&mdash;I have
the honour&mdash;" She touched her glass to his
and they saluted France with the ancient
wine of France&mdash;a sip, a faint smile, and silence
through which their eyes still lingered
for a moment.</p>

<p>"This year is yielding a bitter vintage," he
said. "Light is lacking. But&mdash;but there will
be sun enough another year."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>B'en oui!</hi> The sun must shine again,"
muttered old Anne, "but not in the Woods
of Aulnes. <hi rend='italic'>Non pas.</hi> There is no sunlight
in the Woods of Aulnes where all is dim and
still; where the Blessed walk at dawn with<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
Our Lady of Aulnes in shining vestments
all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She has seen thin mists rising there,"
whispered the Countess in his ear.</p>

<p>"In shining robes of grace&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>oui-da</hi>!&mdash;the
martyrs and the acolytes of God. It is I who
tell you, <hi rend='italic'>beau jeune homme</hi>&mdash;I, Anne of F&auml;ouette.
I saw them pass where, on my two
knees, I gathered orange mushrooms by the
brook! I heard them singing prettily and loud,
hymns of our blessed Lady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She heard a throstle singing by the brook,"
whispered the ch&acirc;telaine of Aulnes. Her
breath was delicately fragrant on his cheek.</p>

<p>Against the grey dusk at the window she
looked to him like a slim spirit returned to
haunt the halls of Aulnes&mdash;some graceful
shade come back out of the hazy and forgotten
years of gallantry and courts and battles&mdash;the
exquisite apparation of that golden
time before the Vend&eacute;e drowned and washed
it out in blood.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you came," she said. "I
have not felt so calm, so confident, in months."</p>

<p>Old Anne of F&auml;ouette laid them fresh nap<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>kins
and set two crystal bowls beside them
and filled the bowls with fresh water from the
moat.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Ho fois!</hi>" she said, "love and the heart
may change, but not the Woods of Aulnes;
they never change&mdash;they never change....
The golden people of Ker-Ys come out of the
sea to walk among the trees."</p>

<p>The Countess whispered: "She has seen
the sunbeams slanting through the trees."</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Vrai, c'est moi, Anne Le Bihan, qui vous
dites cela, mon Capitaine!</hi> And, in the Woods
of Aulnes the werewolf prowls. I have seen
him, gallant gentleman. He walks upright, and,
in his head, he has only eyes; no mouth, no
teeth, no nostrils, and no hair&mdash;the Loup-Garou!&mdash;O
Lady of Aulnes, adored and blessed,
protect us from the Loup-Barou!"</p>

<p>The Countess said again to him: "I have not
felt so confident, so content, so full of faith
in months&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A far faint clamour came to their ears;
high in the fading sky above the forest
vast clouds of wild fowl rose like smoke, whirling,
circling, swinging wide, drifting against<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>

the dying light of day, southward toward the
sea.</p>

<p>"There is something wrong there," he said,
under his breath.</p>

<p>Minute after minute they watched in silence.
The last misty shred of wild fowl floated seaward
and was lost against the clouds.</p>

<p>"Is there a path to the &Eacute;tang?" he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I will go with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"No. Show me the path."</p>

<p>His shotgun stood by the door; he took
it with him as he left the house beside her.
In the moat, close by the bridge, and pointing
toward the house, L'Ombre lay motionless.
They saw it as they passed, but did not speak of
it to each other. At the forest's edge he
halted: "Is this the path?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... May I not go?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;please."</p>

<p>"Is there danger?"</p>

<p>"No.... I don't know if there is any danger."</p>

<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>
<p>"Will you be cautious, then?"</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her in the dim
light. Standing so for a little while they
remained silent. Then he drew a deep, quiet
breath. She held out one hand, slowly; half
way he bent and touched her fingers with
his lips; released them. Her arm fell listlessly
at her side.</p>

<p>After he had been gone a long while, she
turned away, moving with head lowered. At
the bridge she waited for him.</p>

<p>A red moon rose low in the east. It became
golden above the trees, paler higher,
and deathly white in mid-heaven.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight when she went
into the house to light fresh candles. In the
intense darkness before dawn she lighted two
more and set them in an upper window on
the chance that they might guide him back.</p>

<p>At five in the morning every clock struck
five.</p>

<p>She was not asleep; she was lying on a
lounge beside the burning candles, listening,
when the door below burst open and there<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
came the trampling rush of feet, the sound
of blows, a fall&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A loud voice cried:&mdash;"Because you are armed
and not in uniform!&mdash;you British swine!"&mdash;</p>

<p>And the pistol shots crashed through the
house.</p>

<p>On the stairs she swayed for an instant,
grasped blindly at the rail. Through the floating
smoke below the dead man lay there by
the latticed window&mdash;where they had sat together&mdash;he
and she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Spectres were flitting to and fro&mdash;grey
shapes without faces&mdash;things with eyes. A
loud voice dinned in her ears, beat savagely
upon her shrinking brain:</p>

<p>"You there on the stairs!&mdash;do you hear?
What are those candles? Signals?"</p>

<p>She looked down at the dead man.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>Through the crackling racket of the fusillade,
down, down into roaring darkness she
fell.</p>

<p>After a few moments her slim hand moved,
closed over the dead man's. And moved no
more.</p>

<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>
<p>In the moat L'Ombre still remained, unstirring;
old Anne lay in the kitchen dying;
and the Wood of Aulnes was swarming with
ghastly shapes which had no faces, only
eyes.</p>

THE SEED OF DEATH</head>

<p>It was Dr. Vail whose identification secured
burial for Neeland, not in the American cemetery,
but in Aulnes Wood.</p>

<p>When the raid into Finist&egrave;re ended, and
the unclean birds took flight, Vail, at Quimper,
ordered north with his unit, heard of the
tragedy, and went to Aulnes. And so Neeland
was properly buried beside the youthful ch&acirc;telaine.
Which was, no doubt, what his severed
soul desired. And perhaps hers desired it, too.</p>

<p>Vail continued on to Paris, to Flanders,
got gassed, and came back to New York.</p>

<p>He had aged ten years in as many months.</p>

<p>Gray, the younger surgeon, kept glancing
from time to time at Vail's pallid face, and
the latter understood the professional interest
of the younger man.</p>

<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
<p>"You think I look ill?" he asked, finally.</p>

<p>"You don't look very fit, Doctor."</p>

<p>"No.... I'm <hi rend='italic'>going West</hi>."</p>

<p>"You mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that you are&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>going
West</hi>?"</p>

<p>"There's a thing over there, born of gas.
It's a living thing, animal or vegetable. I don't
know which. It's only recently been recognized.
We call it the 'Seed of Death.'"</p>

<p>Gray gazed at the haggard face of the older
man in silence.</p>

<p>Vail went on, slowly: "It's properly named.
It is always fatal. A man may live for a
few months. But, once gassed, even in the
slightest degree, if that germ is inhaled, death
is certain."</p>

<p>After a silence Gray began: "Do you have
any apprehension&mdash;" And did not finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>Vail shrugged. "It's interesting, isn't it?"
he said with pleasant impersonality.</p>

<p>After a silence Gray said: "Are you doing
anything about it?"</p>

<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>
<p>"Oh, yes. It's working in the dark, of course.
I'm feeling rottener every day."</p>

<p>He rested his handsome head on one thin
hand:</p>

<p>"I don't want to die, Gray, but I don't know
how to keep alive. It's odd, isn't it? I don't
wish to die. It's an interesting world. I want
to see how the local elections turn out in New
York."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. That is what worries me more
than anything. We Allies are sure to win.
I'm not worrying about that. But I'd like to
live to see Tammany a dead cock in the pit!"</p>

<p>Gray forced a laugh; Vail laughed unfeignedly,
and then, solemn again, said:</p>

<p>"I'd like to live to see this country aspire
to something really noble."</p>

<p>"After all," said Gray, "there is really nothing
to stifle aspiration."</p>

<p>It was not only because Vail had been gazing
upon death in every phase, every degree&mdash;on
brutal destruction wholesale and in detail;
but also he had been standing on the outer
escarpment of Civilization and had watched<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>
the mounting sea of barbarism battering, thundering,
undermining, gradually engulfing the
world itself and all its ancient liberties.</p>

<p>He and the young surgeon, Gray, who was to
sail to France next day were alone together
on the loggia of the club; dusk mitigated the
infernal heat of a summer day in town.</p>

<p>On the avenue below motor cars moved
north and south, hansoms crept slowly along
the curb, and on the hot sidewalks people
passed listlessly under the electric lights&mdash;the
nine&mdash;and&mdash;seventy sweating tribes.</p>

<p>For, on such summer nights, under the red
moon, an exodus from the East Side peoples
the noble avenue with dingy spectres who shuffle
along the gilded grilles and still fa&ccedil;ades of
stone, up and down, to and fro, in quest of
God knows what&mdash;of air perhaps, perhaps of
happiness, or of something even vaguer. But
whatever it may be that starts them into painful
motion, one thing seems certain: aspiration
is a part of their unrest.</p>

<p>"There is liberty here," replied Dr. Vail&mdash;"also
her inevitable shadow, tyranny."</p>

<p>"We need more light; that's all," said Gray.</p>

<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>
<p>"When light streams in from every angle no
shadow is possible."</p>

<p>"The millennium? I get you.... In this
country the main thing is that there is <hi rend='italic'>some</hi>
light. A single ray, however feeble, and even
coming from one fixed angle only, means aspiration,
life...."</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"As you know," he remarked, "there is a
flower called <hi rend='italic'>Aconitum</hi>. It is also known by
the ominous names of Monks-Hood and Helmet-Flower.
Direct sunlight kills it. It flourishes
only in shadow. Like the Kaiser-Flower
it also is blue; and," he added, "it is deadly
poison.... As you say, the necessary thing
in this world is light from every angle."</p>

<p>His cigar glimmered dully through the silence.
Presently he went on; "Speaking of
tyranny, I think it may be classed as a recognized
and tolerated business carried on successfully
by those born with a genius for it.
It flourishes in the shade&mdash;like the Helmet-Flower....
But the sun in this Western
Hemisphere of ours is devilish hot. It's gradually
killing off our local tyrants&mdash;slowly, al<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>most

<corr sic='imperceptiby'>imperceptibly</corr> but inexorably, killing 'em
off.... Of course, there are plenty still alive&mdash;tyrants
of every degree born to the business
of tyranny and making a success at it."</p>

<p>He smoked tranquilly for a while, then:</p>

<p>"There are our tyrants of industry," he said;
"tyrants of politics, tyrants of religion&mdash;great
and small we still harbor plenty of tyrants,
all scheming to keep their roots from shriveling
under this fierce western sun of ours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed without mirth, turning his worn
and saddened eyes on Gray:</p>

<p>"Tyranny is a business," he repeated; "also
it is a state of mind&mdash;a delusion, a ruling
passion&mdash;strong even in death.... The odd
part of it is that a tyrant never knows he's
one.... He invariably mistakes himself for
a local Moses. I can tell you a sort of story
if you care to listen.... Or, we can go to
some cheerful show or roof-garden&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on with your story," said Gray.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII<lb/><lb/>

FIFTY-FIFTY</head>

<p>Vail began:</p>

<p>Tyranny was purely a matter of business
with this little moral shrimp about whom I'm
going to tell you. I was standing between
a communication trench and a crater left by
a mine which was being "consolidated," as they
have it in these days.... All around me soldiers
of the third line swarmed and clambered
over the d&eacute;bris, digging, hammering, shifting
planks and sandbags from south to north,
lugging new timbers, reels of barbed wire, ladders,
cases of ammunition, machine guns, trench
mortars.</p>

<p>The din of the guns was terrific; overhead
our own shells passed with a deafening, clattering
roar; the Huns continued to shell the
town in front of us where our first and second<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>
lines were still fighting in the streets and
houses while the third line were reconstructing
a few yards of trenches and a few craters
won.</p>

<p>Stretchers and bearers from my section had
not yet returned from the emergency dressing
station; the crater was now cleared up
except of enemy dead, whose partly buried
arms and legs still stuck out here and there.
A company of the Third Foreign Legion had
just come into the crater and had taken station
at the loopholes under the parapet of
sandbags.</p>

<p>As soon as the telephone wires were
stretched as far as our crater a message came
for me to remain where I was until further
orders. I had just received this message and
was walking along, slowly, behind the rank of
soldiers, who stood leaning against the parapet
with their rifles thrust through the loops,
when somebody said in English&mdash;in East Side
New York English I mean&mdash;"Ah, there, Doc!"</p>

<p>A soldier had turned toward me, both hands
still grasping his resting rifle. In the "horizon
blue" uniform and ugly, iron, shrapnel-proof<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>
helmet strapped to his bullet head I failed
to recognize him.</p>

<p>"It's me, 'Duck' Werner," he said, as I
stood hesitating.... You know who he is, political
leader in the 50th Ward, here. I was astounded.</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" he added.
"Me in a tin derby potting Fritzies! And
there's Heinie, too, and Pick-em-up Joe&mdash;the
whole bunch sewed up in this here trench, oh
my God!"</p>

<p>I went over to him and stood leaning against
the parapet beside him.</p>

<p>"Duck," I said, amazed, "how did <hi rend='italic'>you</hi> come
to enlist in the Foreign Legion?"</p>

<p>"Aw," he replied with infinite disgust, "I got
drunk."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Me and Heinie and Joe was follerin' the
races down to Boolong when this here war
come and put everything on the blink. Aw,
hell, sez I, come on back to Parus an' look
'em over before we skiddoo home&mdash;meanin'
the dames an' all like that. Say, we done
what I said; we come back to Parus, an' we<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>

got in wrong! Listen, Doc; them dames had
went crazy over this here war graft. Veeve
France, sez they. An' by God! we veeved.</p>

<p>"An' one of 'em at Maxeems got me soused,
and others they fixed up Heinie an' Joe, an'
we was all wavin' little American flags and
yellin' 'To hell with the Hun!' Then there
was a interval for which I can't account to
nobody.</p>

<p>"All I seem to remember is my marchin'
in the boolyvard along with a guy in baggy
red pants, and my chewin' the rag in a big,
hot room full o' soldiers; an' Heinie an' Joe
they was shoutin', 'Wow! Lemme at 'em.
Veeve la France!' Wha' d'ye know about me?
Ain't I the mark from home?"</p>

<p>"You didn't realize that you were enlisting?"</p>

<p>"Aw, does it make any difference to these
here guys what you reelize, or what you don't?
I ask you, Doc?"</p>

<p>He spat disgustedly upon the sand, rolled
his quid into the other cheek, wiped his thin
lips with the back of his right hand, then his
fingers mechanically sought the trigger guard<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>

again and he cast a perfunctory squint up at
the parapet.</p>

<p>"Believe me," he said, "a guy can veeve himself
into any kind of trouble if he yells loud
enough. I'm getting mine."</p>

<p>"Well, Duck," I said, "it's a good game&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw," he retorted angrily, "it ain't my graft
an' you know it. What do I care who veeves
over here?&mdash;An' the 50th Ward goin' to hell
an' all!"</p>

<p>I strove to readjust my mind to understand
what he had said. I was, you know, that year,
the Citizen's Anti-Graft leader in the 50th
Ward.... I am, still, if I live; and if I
ever can get anything into my head except the
stupendous din of this war and the cataclysmic
problems depending upon its outcome....
Well, it was odd to remember that petty political
conflict as I stood there in the trenches
under the gigantic shadow of world-wide disaster&mdash;to
find myself there, talking with this
sallow, wiry, shifty ward leader&mdash;this corrupt
little local tyrant whom I had opposed in the
50th Ward&mdash;this ex-lightweight bruiser, ex-gunman&mdash;this
dirty little political procurer who<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>

had been and was everything brutal, stealthy,
and corrupt.</p>

<p>I looked at him curiously; turned and glanced
along the line where, presently, I recognized
his two familiars, Heinie Baum and Pick-em-up
Joe Brady with whom he had started off to
"Parus" on a month's summer junket, and with
whom he had stumbled so ludicrously into the
riff-raff ranks of the 3rd Foreign Legion.
Doubtless the 1st and 2nd Legions couldn't
stand him and his two friends, although in one
company there were many Americans serving.</p>

<p>Thinking of these things, the thunder of the
cannonade shaking sand from the parapet, I became
conscious that the rat eyes of Duck Werner
were furtively watching me.</p>

<p>"You can do me dirt, now, can't you, Doc?"
he said with a leer.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Aw, as if I had to tell you. I got some sense
left."</p>

<p>Suddenly his sallow visage under the iron
helmet became distorted with helpless fury; he
fairly snarled; his thin lips writhed as he spat
out the suspicion which had seized him:</p>

<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
<p>"By God, Doc, if you do that!&mdash;if you leave
me here caged up an' go home an' raise hell
in the 50th&mdash;with me an' Joe here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>After a breathless pause: "Well," said I,
"what will you do about it?"&mdash;for he was looking
murder at me.</p>

<p>Neither of us spoke again for a few moments;
an officer, smoking a cigarette, came up
between Heinie and Pick-em-up Joe, adjusted
a periscope and set his eye to it. Through
the sky above us the shells raced as though
hundreds of shaky express trains were rushing
overhead on rickety a&euml;rial tracks, deafening
the world with their outrageous clatter.</p>

<p>"Listen, Doc&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked up into his altered face&mdash;a sallow,
earnest face, fiercely intent. Every atom of
the man's intelligence was alert, concentrated
on me, on my expression, on my slightest
movement.</p>

<p>"Doc," he said, "let's talk business. We're
men, we are, you an' me. I've fought you
plenty times. I <hi rend='italic'>know</hi>. An' I guess you are
on to me, too. I ain't no squealer; you know
that anyway. Perhaps I'm everything else<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>
you claim I am when you make parlor speeches
to Gussie an' Reggie an' when you stand on
a bar'l in Avenoo A an' say: 'my friends' to
Billy an' Izzy an' Pete the Wop.</p>

<p>"All right. Go to it! I'm it. I got mine.
That's what I'm there for. But&mdash;when I get
mine, the guys that back me get theirs, too.
My God, Doc, let's talk business! What's a
little graft between friends?"</p>

<p>"Duck," I said, "you own the 50th Ward.
You are no fool. Why is it not possible for
you to understand that some men don't graft?"</p>

<p>"Aw, can it!" he retorted fiercely. "What
else is there to chase except graft? What
else is there, I ask you? Graft! Ain't there
graft into everything God ever made? An'
don't the smart guy get it an' take his an'
divide the rest same as you an' me?"</p>

<p>"You can't comprehend that I don't graft,
can you, Duck?"</p>

<p>"What do you call it what you get, then?
The wages of Reeform? And what do you
hand out to your lootenants an' your friends?"</p>

<p>"Service."</p>

<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>

<p>"Hey? Well, all right. But what's in it for
you? Where do you get yours, Doc?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing in it for me except to give
honest service to the people who trust me."</p>

<p>"Listen," he persisted with a sort of ferocious
patience; "you ain't on no bar'l now; an'
you ain't calling no Ginneys and no Kikes
your friends. You're just talkin' to me like
there wasn't nobody else onto this damn
planet excep' us two guys. Get that?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And I'm tellin' you that I get mine same
as any one who ain't a loonatic. Get that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"All right. Now I know you ain't no nut.
Which means that you get yours, whatever
you call it. And <hi rend='italic'>now</hi> will you talk business?"</p>

<p>"What business do you want to talk, Duck?"
I added; "I should say that you already have
your hands rather full of business and Lebel
rifles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw' Gawd; <hi rend='italic'>this</hi>? This ain't business. I was
a damn fool and I'm doin' time like any souse
what the bulls pinch. Only I get more than
thirty days, I do. That's what's killin' me,<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>
Doc!&mdash;Duck Werner in a tin lid, suckin' soup
an' shootin' Fritzies when I oughter be in
Noo York with me fren's lookin' after business.
Can you beat it?" he ended fiercely.</p>

<p>He chewed hard on his quid for a few moments,
staring blankly into space with the detached
ferocity of a caged tiger.</p>

<p>"What are they a-doin' over there in the
50th?" he demanded. "How do I know whose
knifin' me with the boys? I don't mean your
party. You're here same as I am. I mean
Mike the Kike, and the regular Reepublican
nomination, I do.... And, how do I know
when <hi rend='italic'>you</hi> are going back?"</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Are</hi> you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Doc, will you talk business, man to man?"</p>

<p>"Duck, to tell you the truth, the hell that is
in full blast over here&mdash;this gigantic, world-wide
battle of nations&mdash;leaves me, for the
time, uninterested in ward politics."</p>

<p>"Stop your kiddin'."</p>

<p>"Can't you comprehend it?"</p>

<p>"Aw, what do you care about what Kink wins?<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>
If we was Kinks, you an' me, all right. But
we ain't Doc. We're little fellows. Our graft
ain't big like the Dutch Emperor's, but maybe
it comes just as regular on pay day. Ich ka
bibble."</p>

<p>"Duck," I said, "you explain your presence
here by telling me that you enlisted while
drunk. How do you explain my being here?"</p>

<p>"You're a Doc. I guess there must be big
money into it," he returned with a wink.</p>

<p>"I draw no pay."</p>

<p>"I believe you," he remarked, leering. "Say,
don't you do that to me, Doc. I may be unfortunit;
I'm a poor damn fool an' I know it.
But don't tell me you're here for your health."</p>

<p>"I won't repeat it, Duck," I said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Much obliged. Now for God's sake let's
talk business. You think you've got me cinched.
You think you can go home an' raise hell in the
50th while I'm doin' time into these here
trenches. You sez to yourself, 'O there ain't
nothin' to it!' An' then you tickles yourself
under the ribs, Doc. You better make a deal
with me, do you hear? Gimme mine, and you
can have yours, too; and between us, if we<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>
work together, we can hand one to Mike the
Kike that'll start every ambulance in the city
after him. Get me?"</p>

<p>"There's no use discussing such things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. I won't ask you to make it
fifty-fifty. Gimme half what I oughter have.
You can fix it with Curley Tim Brady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Duck, this is no time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell! It's all the time I've got! What
do you expec' out here, a caffy dansong? I
don't see no corner gin-mills around neither.
Listen, Doc, quit up-stagin'! You an' me kick
the block off'n this here Kike-Wop if we get
together. All I ask of you is to talk business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I moved aside, and backward a little way,
disgusted with the ratty soul of the man, and
stood looking at the soldiers who were digging
out bombproof burrows all along the
trench and shoring up the holes with heavy,
green planks.</p>

<p>Everybody was methodically busy in one way
or another behind the long rank of Legionaries
who stood at the loops, the butts of the
Lebel rifles against their shoulders.</p>

<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>
<p>Some sawed planks to shore up dugouts;
some were constructing short ladders out of
the trunks of slender green saplings; some
filled sacks with earth to fill the gaps on the
parapet above; others sharpened pegs and
drove them into the dirt fa&ccedil;ade of the trench,
one above the other, as footholds for the men
when a charge was ordered.</p>

<p>Behind me, above my head, wild flowers and
long wild grasses drooped over the raw edge
of the parados, and a few stalks of ripening
wheat trailed there or stood out against the
sky&mdash;an opaque, uncertain sky which had been
so calmly blue, but which was now sickening
with that whitish pallor which presages a
storm.</p>

<p>Once or twice there came the smashing tinkle
of glass as a periscope was struck and a vexed
officer, still holding it, passed it to a rifleman
to be laid aside.</p>

<p>Only one man was hit. He had been fitting
a shutter to the tiny embrasure between
sandbags where a machine gun was to be
mounted; and the bullet came through and<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
entered his head in the center of the triangle
between nose and eyebrows.</p>

<p>A little later when I was returning from
that job, walking slowly along the trench,
Pick-em-up Joe hailed me cheerfully, and I
glanced up to where he and Heinie stood
with their rifles thrust between the sandbags
and their grimy fists clutching barrel and
butt.</p>

<p>"Hello, Heinie!" I said pleasantly. "How
are you, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Commong &ccedil;a va?" inquired Heinie, evidently
mortified at his situation and condition,
but putting on the careless front of a
gunman in a strange ward.</p>

<p>Pick-em-up Joe added jauntily: "Well, Doc,
what's the good word?"</p>

<p>"France," I replied, smiling; "Do you know
a better word?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "Noo York. Say, what's
your little graft over here, Doc?"</p>

<p>"You and I reverse r&ocirc;les, Pick-em-up; you
<hi rend='italic'>stop</hi> bullets; <hi rend='italic'>I</hi> pick 'em up&mdash;after you're
through with 'em."</p>

<p>"The hell you say!" he retorted, grinning.<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
"Well, grab it from me, if it wasn't for the
Jack Johnsons and the gas, a gun fight in
the old 50th would make this war look like
Luna Park! It listens like it, too, only this
here show is all fi-<hi rend='italic'>nally</hi>, with Bingle's Band
playin' circus tunes an' the supes hollerin' like
they seen real money."</p>

<p>He was a merry ruffian, and he controlled
the "coke" graft in the 50th while Heinie was
perpetual bondsman for local Magdalenes.</p>

<p>"Well, ain't we in Dutch&mdash;us three guys!"
he remarked with forced carelessness. "We
sure done it that time."</p>

<p>"Did you do business with Duck?" inquired
Pick-em-up, curiously.</p>

<p>"Not so he noticed it. Joe, can't you and
Heinie rise to your opportunities? This is
the first time in your lives you've ever been
decent, ever done a respectable thing. Can't
you start in and live straight&mdash;think straight?
You're wearing the uniform of God's own
soldiers; you're standing shoulder to shoulder
with men who are fighting God's own battle.
The fate of every woman, every child,
every unborn baby in Europe&mdash;and in Amer<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>ica,
too&mdash;depends on your bravery. If you
don't win out, it will be our turn next. If
you don't stop the Huns&mdash;if you don't come
back at them and wipe them out, the world
will not be worth inhabiting."</p>

<p>I stepped nearer: "Heinie," I said, "you
know what your trade has been, and what it is
called. Here's your chance to clean yourself.
Joe&mdash;you've dealt out misery, insanity, death,
to women and children. You're called the
Coke King of the East Side. Joe, we'll get
you sooner or later. Don't take the trouble
to doubt it. Why not order a new pack and
a fresh deal? Why not resolve to live straight
from this moment&mdash;here where you have taken
your place in the ranks among real men&mdash;here
where this army stands for liberty, for the
right to live! You've got your chance to
become a real man; so has Heinie. And
when you come back, we'll stand by you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' gimme a job choppin' tickets in the
subway!" snarled Heinie. "Expec' me to squeal
f'r that? Reeform, hey? Show me a livin' in
it an' I carry a banner. But there ain't<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>

nothing into it. How's a guy to live if there
ain't no graft into nothin'?"</p>

<p>Joe touched his gas-mask with a sneer:
"He's pushin' the yellow stuff at us, Heinie,"
he said; and to me: "You get <hi rend='italic'>yours</hi> all right.
I don't know what it is, but you get it, same
as me an' Heinie an' Duck. <hi rend='italic'>I</hi> don't know
what it is," he repeated impatiently; "maybe
it's dough; maybe it's them suffragettes with
their silk feet an' white gloves what clap
their hands at you. <hi rend='italic'>I</hi> ain't saying nothin'
to <hi rend='italic'>you</hi>, am I? Then lemme alone an' go an'
talk business with Duck over there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Officers passed rapidly between the speaker
and me and continued east and west along
the ranks of riflemen, repeating in calm, steady
voices:</p>

<p>"Fix bayonets, <hi rend='italic'>mes enfants</hi>; make as little
noise as possible. Everybody ready in ten
minutes. Ladders will be distributed. Take
them with you. The bomb-throwers will leave
the trench first. Put on goggles and respirators.
Fix bayonets and set one foot on the
pegs and ladders ... all ready in seven minutes.
Three mines will be exploded. Take<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>
and hold the craters.... Five minutes!...
When the mines explode that is your signal.
Bombers lead. Give them a leg up and follow....
Three minutes...."</p>

<p>From a communication trench a long file of
masked bomb-throwers appeared, loaded sacks
slung under their left arms, bombs clutched
in their right hands; and took stations at
every ladder and row of freshly driven pegs.</p>

<p>"One minute!" repeated the officers, selecting
their own ladders and drawing their long
knives and automatics.</p>

<p>As I finished adjusting my respirator and
goggles a muffled voice at my elbow began:
"Be a sport, Doc! Gimme a chanst! Make
it fifty-fifty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Allez!</hi>" shouted an officer through his respirator.</p>

<p>Against the sky all along the parapet's edge
hundreds of bayonets wavered for a second;
then dark figures leaped up, scrambled,
crawled forward, rose, ran out into the sunless,
pallid light.</p>

<p>Like surf bursting along a coast a curtain
of exploding shells stretched straight across the<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>
d&eacute;bris of what had been a meadow&mdash;a long
line of livid obscurity split with flame and
storms of driving sand and gravel. Shrapnel
leisurely unfolded its cottony coils overhead
and the iron helmets rang under the hail.</p>

<p>Men fell forward, backward, sideways, remaining
motionless, or rolling about, or rising
to limp on again. There was smoke, now, and
mire, and the unbroken rattle of machine guns.</p>

<p>Ahead, men were fishing in their sacks and
throwing bombs like a pack of boys stoning
a snake; I caught glimpses of them furiously
at work from where I knelt beside one fallen
man after another, desperately busy with my
own business.</p>

<p>Bearers ran out where I was at work, not
my own company but some French ambulance
sections who served me as well as their own
surgeons where, in a shell crater partly full
of water, we found some shelter for the
wounded.</p>

<p>Over us black smoke from the Jack Johnsons
rolled as it rolls out of the stacks of soft-coal
burning locomotives; the outrageous din
never slackened, but our deafened ears had<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>
become insensible under the repeated blows of
sound, yet not paralyzed. For I remember,
squatting there in that shell crater, hearing
a cricket tranquilly tuning up between the
thunderclaps which shook earth and sods down
on us and wrinkled the pool of water at our
feet.</p>

<p>The Legion had taken the trench; but the
place was a rabbit warren where hundreds of
holes and burrows and ditches and communicating
runways made a bewildering maze.</p>

<p>And everywhere in the dull, flame-shot obscurity,
the Legionaries ran about like ghouls
in their hoods and round, hollow eye-holes;
masked faces, indistinct in the smoke, loomed
grotesque and horrible as Ku-Klux where the
bayonets were at work digging out the enemy
from blind burrows, turning them up from
their bloody forms.</p>

<p>Rifles blazed down into bomb-proofs, cracked
steadily over the heads of comrades who piled
up sandbags to block communication trenches;
grenade-bombs rained down through the smoke
into trenches, blowing bloody gaps in huddling
masses of struggling Teutons until they flat<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>tened
back against the parados and lifted
arms and gun-butts stammering out, "Comrades!
Comrades!"&mdash;in the ghastly irony of
surrender.</p>

<p>A man whose entire helmet, gas-mask, and
face had been blown off, and who was still
alive and trying to speak, stiffened, relaxed,
and died in my arms. As I rolled him aside
and turned to the next man whom the bearers
were lowering into the crater, his respirator
and goggles fell apart, and I found myself
looking into the ashy face of Duck Werner.</p>

<p>As we laid him out and stripped away iron
helmet and tunic, he said in a natural and
distinct voice.</p>

<p>"Through the belly, Doc. Gimme a drink."</p>

<p>There was no more water or stimulant at
the moment and the puddle in the crater was
bloody. He said, patiently, "All right; I can
wait.... It's in the belly.... It ain't nothin',
is it?"</p>

<p>I said something reassuring, something about
the percentage of recovery I believe, for I
was exceedingly busy with Duck's anatomy.</p>

<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>
<p>"Pull me through, Doc?" he inquired calmly.</p>

<p>"Sure...."</p>

<p>"Aw, listen, Doc. Don't hand me no cones
of hokey-pokey. Gimme a deck of the stuff.
Dope out the coke. Do I get mine this trip?"</p>

<p>I looked at him, hesitating.</p>

<p>"Listen, Doc, am I hurted bad? Gimme a
hones' deal. Do I croak?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk, Duck&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dope it straight. <hi rend='italic'>Do</hi> I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd say that," he returned serenely.
"Now I'm goin' to fool you, same as
I fooled them guys at Bellevue the night that
Mike the Kike shot me up in the subway."</p>

<p>A pallid sneer stretched his thin and burning
lips; in his ratty eyes triumph gleamed.</p>

<p>"I've went through worse than this. I ain't
hurted bad. I ain't got mine just yet, old
scout! Would I leave meself croak&mdash;an' that
bum, Mike the Kike, handin' me fren's the
ha-ha! Gawd," he muttered hazily, as though
his mind was beginning to cloud, "just f'r that
I'll get up an'&mdash;an' go&mdash;home&mdash;" His voice
flattened out and he lay silent.</p>

<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
<p>Working over the next man beyond him
and glancing around now and then to discover
a <hi rend='italic'>brancardier</hi> who might take Duck to
the rear, I presently caught his eyes fixed
on me.</p>

<p>"Say, Doc, will you talk&mdash;business?" he asked
in a dull voice.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Duck, the bearers will be here
in a minute or two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"T'hell wit them guys! I'm askin' you will
you make it fifty-fifty&mdash;'r' somethin'&mdash;" Again
his voice trailed away, but his bright ratty
eyes were indomitable.</p>

<p>I was bloodily occupied with another patient
when something struck me on the shoulder&mdash;a
human hand, clutching it. Duck was
sitting upright, eyes a-glitter, the other hand
pressed heavily over his abdomen.</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty!" he cried in a shrill voice.
"F'r Christ's sake, Doc, talk business&mdash;" And
life went out inside him&mdash;like the flame of a
suddenly snuffed candle&mdash;while he still sat
there....</p>

<p>I heard the air escaping from his lungs<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
before he toppled over.... I swear to you it
sounded like a whispered word&mdash;"business."</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>"Then came their gas&mdash;a great, thick, yellow
billow of it pouring into our shell hole....
I couldn't get my mask on fast enough ...
and here I am, Gray, wondering, but really
knowing.... Are you stopping at the Club
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Vail got to his feet unsteadily: "I'm feeling
rather done in.... Won't sit up any longer,
I guess.... See you in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gray.</p>

<p>"Good-night, then. Look in on me if you
leave before I'm up."</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>And that is how Gray saw him before he
sailed&mdash;stopped at his door, knocked, and, receiving
no response, opened and looked in.
After a few moments' silence he understood
that the "Seed of Death" had sprouted.</p>

MULETEERS</head>

<p>Lying far to the southwest of the battle
line, only when a strong northwest wind blew
could Sainte Lesse hear the thudding of cannon
beyond the horizon. And once, when the
northeast wind had blown steadily for a
week, on the wings of the driving drizzle had
come a faint but dreadful odour which hung
among the streets and lanes until the wind
changed.</p>

<p>Except for the carillon, nothing louder than
the call of a cuckoo, the lowing of cattle or
a goatherd's piping ever broke the summer
silence in the little town. Birds sang; a
shallow river rippled; breezes ruffled green
grain into long, silvery waves across the valley;
sunshine fell on quiet streets, on scented
gardens unsoiled by war, on groves and<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>
meadows, and on the stone-edged brink of
brimming pools where washerwomen knelt
among the wild flowers, splashing amid floating
pyramids of snowy suds.</p>

<p>And into the exquisite peace of this little
paradise rode John Burley with a thousand
American mules.</p>

<p>The town had been warned of this impending
visitation; had watched preparations for
it during April and May when a corral was
erected down in a meadow and some huts
and stables were put up among the groves of
poplar and sycamore, and a small barracks
was built to accommodate the negro guardians
of the mules and a peloton of gendarmes
under a fat brigadier.</p>

<p>Sainte Lesse as yet knew nothing personally
of the American mule or of Burley.
<corr sic='Saine'>Sainte</corr> Lesse heard both before it beheld either&mdash;Burley's
loud, careless, swaggering voice
above the hee-haw of his trampling herds:</p>

<p>"All I ask for is human food, Smith&mdash;not
luxuries&mdash;just food!&mdash;and that of the commonest
kind."</p>

<p>And now an immense volume of noise and<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>
dust enveloped the main street of Sainte
Lesse, stilling the quiet noon gossip of the
town, silencing the birds, awing the town
dogs so that their impending barking died
to amazed gurgles drowned in the din of the
mules.</p>

<p>Astride a cream-coloured, wall-eyed mule,
erect in his saddle, talkative, gesticulating,
good-humoured, famished but gay, rode Burley
at the head of the column, his reckless
grey eyes glancing amiably right and left at
the good people of Sainte Lesse who clustered
silently at their doorways under the
trees to observe the passing of this noisy,
unfamiliar procession.</p>

<p>Mules, dust; mules, dust, and then more
mules, all enveloped in dust, clattering, ambling,
trotting, bucking, shying, kicking, halting,
backing; and here and there an American
negro cracking a long snake whip with
strange, aboriginal ejaculations; and three
white men in khaki riding beside the
trampling column, smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Sticky" Smith and "Kid" Glenn rode
mules on the column's flank; Burley continued<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
to lead on his wall-eyed animal, preceded now
by the fat brigadier of the gendarmerie, upon
whom he had bestowed a cigarette.</p>

<p>Burley, talking all the while from his saddle
to whoever cared to listen, or to himself
if nobody cared to listen, rode on in the van
under the ancient bell-tower of Sainte Lesse,
where a slim, dark-eyed girl looked up at
him as he passed, a faint smile hovering on
her lips.</p>

<p>"Bong jour, Mademoiselle," continued Burley,
saluting her <hi rend='italic'>en passant</hi> with two fingers
at the vizor of his khaki cap, as he had seen
British officers salute. "I compliment you on
your silent but eloquent welcome to me, my
comrades, my coons, and my mules. Your
charming though slightly melancholy smile
bids us indeed welcome to your fair city. I
thank you; I thank all the inhabitants for
this unprecedented ovation. Doubtless a municipal
banquet awaits us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sticky Smith spurred up.</p>

<p>"Did you see the inn?" he asked. "There
it is, to the right."</p>

<p>"It looks good to me," said Burley.<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>

"Everything looks good to me except these
accursed mules. Thank God, that seems to
be the corral&mdash;down in the meadow there,
Brigadeer!"</p>

<p>The fat brigadier drew bridle; Burley burst
into French:</p>

<p>"Esker&mdash;esker&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Oui</hi>," nodded the brigadier, "that is where
we are going."</p>

<p>"Bong!" exclaimed Burley with satisfaction;
and, turning to Sticky Smith: "Stick,
tell the coons to hustle. We're there!"</p>

<p>Then, above the trampling, whip-cracking,
and shouting of the negroes, from somewhere
high in the blue sky overhead, out of limpid,
cloudless heights floated a single bell-note,
then another, another, others exquisitely
sweet and clear, melting into a fragment of
heavenly melody.</p>

<p>Burley looked up into the sky; the negroes
raised their sweating, dark faces in pleased
astonishment; Stick and Kid Glenn lifted
puzzled visages to the zenith. The fat brigadier
smiled and waved his cigarette:</p>

<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Il est midi, messieurs.</hi> That is the carillon
of Sainte Lesse."</p>

<p>The angelic melody died away. Then, high
in the old bell-tower, a great resonant bell
struck twelve times.</p>

<p>Said the brigadier:</p>

<p>"When the wind is right, they can hear our
big bell, Bayard, out there in the first line
trenches&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he waved his cigarette toward the
northeast, then reined in his horse and backed
off into the flowering meadow, while the first
of the American mules entered the corral,
the herd following pellmell.</p>

<p>The American negroes went with the mules
to a hut prepared for them inside the corral&mdash;it
having been previously and carefully explained
to France that an American mule
without its negro complement was as galvanic
and unaccountable as a beheaded chicken.</p>

<p>Burley burst into French again, like a
shrapnel shell:</p>

<p>"Esker&mdash;esker&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Oui</hi>," said the fat brigadier, "there is an
excellent inn up the street, messieurs." And<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
he saluted their uniform, the same being constructed
of cotton khaki, with a horseshoe
on the arm and an oxidized metal mule on
the collar. The brigadier wondered at and
admired the minute nicety of administrative
detail characterizing a government which
clothed even its muleteers so becomingly, yet
with such modesty and dignity.</p>

<p>He could not know that the uniform was
unauthorized and the insignia an invention
of Sticky Smith, aiming to counteract any
social stigma that might blight his sojourn
in France.</p>

<p>"For," said Sticky Smith, before they went
aboard the transport at New Orleans, "if you
dress a man in khaki, with some gimcrack
on his sleeve and collar, you're level with
anybody in Europe. Which," he added to
Burley, "will make it pleasant if any emperors
or kings drop in on us for a drink or a
quiet game behind the lines."</p>

<p>"Also," added Burley, "it goes with the
ladies." And he and Kid Glenn purchased
uniforms similar to Smith's and had the<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>
horseshoe and mule fastened to sleeve and
collar.</p>

<p>"They'll hang you fellows for francs-tireurs,"
remarked a battered soldier of fortune
from the wharf as the transport cast
off and glided gradually away from the sun-blistered
docks.</p>

<p>"Hang <hi rend='italic'>who</hi>?" demanded Burley loudly
from the rail above.</p>

<p>"What's a frank-tiroor?" inquired Sticky
Smith.</p>

<p>"And who'll hang us?" shouted Kid Glenn
from the deck of the moving steamer.</p>

<p>"The Germans will if they catch you in
that uniform," retorted the battered soldier
of fortune derisively. "You chorus-boy mule
drivers will wish you wore overalls and one
suspender if the Dutch Kaiser nails you!"</p>

LA PLOO BELLE</head>

<p>They had been nearly three weeks on the
voyage, three days in port, four more on
cattle trains, and had been marching since
morning from the nearest railway station at
Estville-sur-Lesse.</p>

<p>Now, lugging their large leather hold-alls,
they started up the main street of Sainte
Lesse, three sunburnt, loud-talking Americans,
young, sturdy, careless of glance and
voice and gesture, perfectly self-satisfied.</p>

<p>Their footsteps echoed loudly on the pavement
of this still, old town, lying so quietly
in the shadow of its aged trees and its sixteenth
century belfry, where the great bell,
Bayard, had hung for hundreds of years, and,
tier on tier above it, clustered in set ranks
the fixed bells of the ancient carillon.</p>

<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
<p>"Some skyscraper," observed Burley, patronizing
the bell-tower with a glance.</p>

<p>As he spoke, they came to the inn, a very
ancient hostelry built into a remnant of the
old town wall, and now a part of it. On the
signboard was painted a white doe; and that
was the name of the inn.</p>

<p>So they trooped through the stone-arched
tunnel, ushered by a lame innkeeper; and
Burley, chancing to turn his head and glance
back through the shadowy stone passage,
caught a glimpse in the outer sunshine of
the girl whose dark eyes had inspired him
with jocular eloquence as he rode on his mule
under the bell-tower of Sainte Lesse.</p>

<p>"A peach," he said to Smith. And the
sight of her apparently going to his head,
he burst into French: "Tray chick! Tray,
tray chick! I'm glad I've got on this uniform
and not overalls and one suspender."</p>

<p>"What's biting you?" inquired Smith.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Stick, nothing. But I believe
I've seen the prettiest girl in the world right
here in this two-by-four town."</p>

<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>
<p>Stick glanced over his shoulder, then
shrugged:</p>

<p>"She's ornamental, only she's got a sad
on."</p>

<p>But Burley trudged on with his leather
hold-all, muttering to himself something
about the prettiest girl in the world.</p>

<p>The "prettiest girl in the world" continued
her way unconscious of the encomiums of
John Burley and the critique of Sticky Smith.
Her way, however, seemed to be the way of
Burley and his two companions, for she
crossed the sunny street and entered the
White Doe by the arched door and tunnel-like
passage.</p>

<p>Unlike them, however, she turned to the
right in the stone corridor, opened a low
wooden door, crossed the inn parlour, ascended
a short stairway, and entered a bedroom.</p>

<p>Here, standing before a mirror, she unpinned
her straw hat, smoothed her dark
hair, resting her eyes pensively for a few
moments on her reflected face. Then she
sauntered listlessly about the little room in
performance of those trivial, aimless offices,<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>
entirely feminine, such as opening all the
drawers in her clothes-press, smoothing out
various frilly objects and fabrics, investigating
a little gilded box and thoughtfully inspecting
its contents, which consisted of hair-pins.
Fussing here, lingering there, loitering
by her bird-cage, where a canary cheeped its
greeting and hopped and hopped; bending
over a cluster of white phlox in a glass of
water to inhale the old-fashioned perfume,
she finally tied on a fresh apron and walked
slowly out to the ancient, vaulted kitchen.</p>

<p>An old peasant woman was cooking, while
a young one washed dishes.</p>

<p>"Are the American gentlemen still at table,
Julie?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Maryette, they are devouring
everything in the house!" exclaimed old
Julie, flinging both hands toward heaven.
"<hi rend='italic'>Tenez</hi>, mamzelle, I have heard of eating in
ancient days, I have read of Gargantua, I
have been told of banquets, of feasting, of
appetites! But there is one American in
there! Mamzelle Maryette, if I should swear
to you that he is on his third chicken and<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
that a row of six pint bottles of '93 Margaux
stand empty on the cloth at his elbow,
I should do no penance for untruthfulness.
<hi rend='italic'>Tenez, Mamzelle Maryette, regardez un peu
par l'oubliette</hi>&mdash;" And old Julie slid open
the wooden shutter on the crack and Maryette
bent forward and surveyed the dining room
outside.</p>

<p>They were laughing very loud in there,
these three Americans&mdash;three powerful, sun-scorched
young men, very much at their ease
around the table, draining the red Bordeaux
by goblets, plying knife and fork with joyous
and undiminished vigour.</p>

<p>The tall one with the crisp hair and clear,
grayish eyes&mdash;he of the three chickens&mdash;was
already achieving the third&mdash;a crisply
browned bird, fresh from the spit, fragrant
and smoking hot. At intervals he buttered
great slices of rye bread, or disposed of an
entire young potato, washing it down with a
goblet of red wine, but always he returned
to the rich roasted fowl which he held, still
impaled upon its spit, and which he carved<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>

as he ate, wings, legs, breast falling in steaming
flakes under his skillful knife blade.</p>

<p>Sticky Smith finally pushed aside his drained
glass and surveyed an empty plate frankly
and regretfully, unable to continue. He said:</p>

<p>"I'm going to bed and I'm going to sleep
twenty-four hours. After that I'm going to
eat for twenty-four more hours, and then I'll
be in good shape. Bong soir."</p>

<p>"Aw, stick around with the push!" remonstrated
Kid Glenn thickly, impaling another
potato upon his fork and gesticulating with it.</p>

<p>Smith gazed with surfeited but hopeless
envy upon Burley's magnificent work with
knife and fork, saw him crack a seventh bottle
of Bordeaux, watched him empty the first
goblet.</p>

<p>But even Glenn's eyes began to dull in
spite of himself, his head nodded mechanically
at every mouthful achieved.</p>

<p>"I gotta call it off, Jack," he yawned.
"Stick and I need the sleep if you don't.
So here's where we quit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me tell you about that girl," began
Burley. "I never saw a prettier&mdash;" But<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>
Glenn had appetite neither for food nor
romance:</p>

<p>"Say, listen. Have a heart, Jack! We
need the sleep!"</p>

<p>Stick had already risen; Glenn shoved back
his chair with a gigantic yawn and shambled
to his feet.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," insisted Burley, "that
she's what the French call tray, tray
chick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stick pointed furiously at the fowl:</p>

<p>"Chick? I'm fed up on chick! Maybe she
is some chick, as you say, but it doesn't interest
me. Goo'bye. Don't come battering
at my door and wake me up, Jack. Be a
sport and lemme alone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned and shuffled out, and Glenn followed,
his Mexican spurs clanking.</p>

<p>Burley jeered them:</p>

<p>"Mollycoddles! Come on and take in the
town with us!"</p>

<p>But they slammed the door behind them,
and he heard them stumbling and clanking
up stairs.</p>

<p>So Burley, gazing gravely at his empty<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>
plate, presently emptied the last visible bottle
of Bordeaux, then stretching his mighty
arms and superb chest, fished out a cigarette,
set fire to it, unhooked the cartridge-belt and
holster from the back of his chair, buckled
it on, rose, pulled on his leather-peaked cap,
and drew a deep breath of contentment.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood in the centre of
the room, as though in pleasant meditation,
then he slowly strode toward the street door,
murmuring to himself: "Tray, tray chick. The
prettiest girl in the world.... La ploo belle
fille du monde ... la ploo belle...."</p>

<p>He strolled as far as the corral down in
the meadow by the stream, where he found
the negro muleteers asleep and the mules
already watered and fed.</p>

<p>For a while he hobnobbed with the three
gendarmes on duty there, practicing his kind
of French on them and managing to understand
and be understood more or less&mdash;probably
less.</p>

<p>But the young man was persistent; he desired
to become that easy master of the
French language that his tongue-tied com<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>rades
believed him to be. So he practiced
garrulously upon the polite, suffering gendarmes.</p>

<p>He related to them his experience on shipboard
with a thousand mutinous mules to
pacify, feed, water, and otherwise cherish.
They had, it appeared, encountered no submarines,
but enjoyed several alarms from
destroyers which eventually proved to be
British.</p>

<p>"A cousin of mine," explained Burley,
"Ned Winters, of El Paso, went down on the
steamer <hi rend='italic'>John B. Doty</hi>, with eleven hundred
mules and six niggers. The Boches torpedoed
the ship and then raked the boats. I'd like
to get a crack at one Boche before I go back
to God's country."</p>

<p>The gendarmes politely but regretfully
agreed that it was impracticable for Burley
to get a crack at a Hun; and the American
presently took himself off to the corral, after
distributing cigarettes and establishing cordial
relations with the Sainte Lesse Gendarmerie.</p>

<p>He waked up a negro and inspected the<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>
mules; that took a long time. Then he sought
out the negro blacksmith, awoke him, and
wrote out some directions.</p>

<p>"The idea is," he explained, "that whenever
the French in this sector need mules
they draw on our corral. We are supposed
to keep ten or eleven hundred mules here all
the time and look after them. Shipments
come every two weeks, I believe. So after
you've had another good nap, George, you
wake up your boys and get busy. And
there'll be trouble if things are not in running
order by tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"Yas, suh, Mistuh Burley," nodded the
sleepy blacksmith, still blinking in the afternoon
sunshine.</p>

<p>"And if you need an interpreter," added
Burley, "always call on me until you learn
French enough to get on. Understand,
George?"</p>

<p>"Yas, suh."</p>

<p>"Because," said Burley, walking away, "a
thorough knowledge of French idioms is
necessary to prevent mistakes. When in
doubt always apply to me, George, for only<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>
a master of the language is competent to
deal with these French people."</p>

<p>It was his one vanity, his one weakness.
Perhaps, because he so ardently desired proficiency,
he had already deluded himself with
the belief that he was a master of French.</p>

<p>So, belt and loaded holster sagging, and
large silver spurs clicking and clinking at
every step, John Burley sauntered back along
the almost deserted street of Sainte Lesse,
thinking sometimes of his mules, sometimes
of the French language, and every now and
then of a dark-eyed, dark-haired girl whose
delicately flushed and pensive gaze he had encountered
as he had ridden into Sainte Lesse
under the old belfry.</p>

<p>"Stick Smith's a fool," he thought to himself
impatiently. "Tray chick doesn't mean
'some chicken.' It means a pretty girl, in
French."</p>

<p>He looked up at the belfry as he passed
under it, and at the same moment, from beneath
the high, gilded dragon which crowned
its topmost spire, a sweet bell-note floated,
another, others succeeding in crystalline<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>

sweetness, linked in a fragment of some ancient
melody. Then they ceased; then came
a brief silence; the great bell he had heard
before struck five times.</p>

<p>"Lord!&mdash;that's pretty," he murmured, moving
on and turning into the arched tunnel
which was the entrance to the White Doe Inn.</p>

<p>Wandering at random, he encountered the
innkeeper in the parlour, studying a crumpled
newspaper through horn-rimmed spectacles
on his nose.</p>

<p>"Tray jolie," said Burley affably, seating
himself with an idea of further practice in
French.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Plait-il?</hi>"</p>

<p>"The bells&mdash;tray beau!"</p>

<p>The old man straightened his bent shoulders
a little proudly.</p>

<p>"For thirty years, m'sieu, I have been Carillonneur
of Sainte Lesse." He smiled; then,
saddened, he held out both hands toward Burley.
The fingers were stiff and crippled with
rheumatism.</p>

<p>"No more," he said slowly; "the carillon is<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>
ended for me. The great art is no more for
Jean Courtray, Master of Bells."</p>

<p>"What is a carillon?" inquired John Burley
simply.</p>

<p>Blank incredulity was succeeded by a
shocked expression on the old man's visage.
After a silence, in mild and patient protest,
he said:</p>

<p>"I am Jean Courtray, Carillonneur of
Sainte Lesse.... Have you never heard of
the carillon of Sainte Lesse, or of me?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Burley. "We don't have
anything like that in America."</p>

<p>The old carillonneur, Jean Courtray, began
to speak in a low voice of his art, his profession,
and of the great carillon of forty-six
bells in the ancient tower of Sainte Lesse.</p>

<p>A carillon, he explained, is a company of
fixed bells tuned according to the chromatic
scale and ranging through several octaves.
These bells, rising tier above tier in a belfry,
the smallest highest, the great, ponderous
bells of the bass notes lowest, are not free
to swing, but are fixed to huge beams, and
are sounded by clappers connected by a wil<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>derness
of wires to a keyboard which is played
upon by the bell-master or carillonneur.</p>

<p>He explained that the office of bell-master
was an ancient one and greatly honoured;
that the bell-master was also a member of the
municipal government; that his salary was a
fixed one; that not only did he play upon the
carillon on f&ecirc;te days, market days, and particular
occasions, but he also travelled and
gave concerts upon the few existing carillons
of other ancient towns and cities, not alone
in France where carillons were few, but in
Belgium and Holland, where they still were
comparatively many, although the German
barbarians had destroyed some of the best at
Li&eacute;ge, Arras, Dixmude, Termonde, and Ypres.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he went on in a voice which
began to grow a little unsteady, "the Huns
have destroyed the ancient carillons of Louvain
and of Mechlin. In the superb bell-tower
of Saint Rombold I have played for a
thousand people; and the Carillonneur, Monsieur
Vincent, and the great bell-master, Josef
Denyn, have come to me to congratulate me
with tears in their eyes&mdash;in their eyes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>
<p>There were tears in his own now, and he
bent his white head and looked down at the
worn floor under his crippled feet.</p>

<p>"Alas," he said, "for Denyn&mdash;and for Saint
Rombold's tower. The Hun has passed that
way."</p>

<p>After a silence:</p>

<p>"Who is it now plays the carillon in Sainte
Lesse!" asked Burley.</p>

<p>"My daughter, Maryette. Sainte Lesse has
honoured me in my daughter, whom I myself
instructed. My daughter&mdash;the little child of
my old age, monsieur&mdash;is mistress of the bells
of Sainte Lesse.... They call her Carillonnette
in Sainte Lesse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened and the girl came in.</p>

CARILLONETTE</head>

<p>Sticky Smith and Kid Glenn remained a
week at Sainte Lesse, then left with the
negroes for Calais to help bring up another
cargo of mules, the arrival of which was daily
expected.</p>

<p>A peloton of the Train-des-Equipages and
three Remount troopers arrived at Sainte
Lesse to take over the corral. John Burley
remained to explain and interpret the American
mule to these perplexed troopers.</p>

<p>Morning, noon, and night he went clanking
down to the corral, his cartridge belt and
holster swinging at his hip. But sometimes
he had a little leisure.</p>

<p>Sainte Lesse knew him as a mighty eater
and as a lusty drinker of good red wine; as
a mighty and garrulous talker, too, he be<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>came
known, ready to accost anybody in the
quiet and subdued old town and explode into
French at the slightest encouragement.</p>

<p>But Burley had only women and children
and old men on whom to practice his earnest
and voluble French, for everybody else was
at the front.</p>

<p>Children adored him&mdash;adored his big, silver
spurs, his cartridge belt and pistol, the
metal mule decorating his tunic collar, his
six feet two of height, his quick smile, the
even white teeth and grayish eyes of this
American muleteer, who always had a stick
of barley sugar to give them or an amazing
trick to perform for them with a handkerchief
or coin that vanished under their very
noses at the magic snap of his finger.</p>

<p>Old men gossiped willingly with him;
women liked him and their rare smiles in the
war-sobered town of Sainte Lesse were often
for him as he sauntered along the quiet street,
clanking, swaggering, affable, ready for conversation
with anybody, and always ready for
the small, confident hands that unceremoni<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>ously
clasped his when he passed by where
children played.</p>

<p>As for Maryette Courtray, called Carillonnette,
she mounted the bell-tower once every
hour, from six in the morning until nine
o'clock in the evening, to play the passing of
Time toward that eternity into which it is
always and ceaselessly moving.</p>

<p>After nine o'clock Carillonnette set the drum
and wound it; and through the dark hours of
the night the bells played mechanically every
hour for a few moments before Bayard
struck.</p>

<p>Between these duties the girl managed the
old inn, to which, since the war, nobody came
any more&mdash;and with these occupations her life
was full&mdash;sufficiently full, perhaps, without
the advent of John Burley.</p>

<p>They met with enough frequency for her,
if not for him. Their encounters took place
between her duties aloft at the keyboard under
the successive tiers of bells and his intervals
of prowling among his mules.</p>

<p>Sometimes he found her sewing in the parlour&mdash;she
could have gone to her own room,<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
of course; sometimes he encountered her in
the corridor, in the street, in the walled garden
behind the inn, where with basket and
pan she gathered vegetables in season.</p>

<p>There was a stone seat out there, built
against the southern wall, and in the shadowed
coolness of it she sometimes shelled
peas.</p>

<p>During such an hour of liberty from the
bell-tower he found the dark-eyed little mistress
of the bells sorting various vegetables
and singing under her breath to herself the
carillon music of Josef Denyn.</p>

<p>"Tray chick, mademoiselle," he said, with
a cheerful self-assertion, to hide the embarrassment
which always assailed him when he
encountered her.</p>

<p>"You know, Monsieur Burley, you should
not say '<hi rend='italic'>tr&egrave;s chic</hi>' to me," she said, shaking
her pretty head. "It sounds a little familiar
and a little common."</p>

<p>"Oh," he exclaimed, very red. "I thought
it was the thing to say."</p>

<p>She smiled, continuing to shell the peas,
then, with her sensitive and slightly flushed<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>
face still lowered, she looked at him out of
her dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she said, "young men say
'<hi rend='italic'>tr&egrave;s chic</hi>.' It depend on when and how one
says it."</p>

<p>"Are there times when it is all right for
me to say it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so.... How are your mules
today?"</p>

<p>"The same," he said, "&mdash;ready to bite or
kick or eat their heads off. The Remount
took two hundred this morning."</p>

<p>"I saw them pass," said the girl. "I
thought perhaps you also might be departing."</p>

<p>"Without coming to say good-bye&mdash;to <hi rend='italic'>you</hi>!"
he stammered.</p>

<p>"Oh, conventions must be disregarded in
time of war," she returned carelessly, continuing
to shell peas. "I really thought I
saw you riding away with the mules."</p>

<p>"That man," said Burley, much hurt, "was
a bow-legged driver of the Train-des-Equipages.
I don't think he resembles me."</p>

<p>As she made no comment and expressed no<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>
contrition for her mistake, he gazed about
him at the sunny garden with a depressed
expression. However, this changed presently
to a bright and hopeful one.</p>

<p>"Vooz ate tray, tray belle, mademoiselle!"
he asserted cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Monsieur!" Vexed perhaps as much at
her own quick blush as his abrupt eulogy, she
bit her lip and looked at him with an ominously
level gaze. Then, suddenly, she smiled.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Burley, one does <hi rend='italic'>not</hi> so express
one's self without reason, without apropos,
without&mdash;without encouragement&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She blushed again, vividly. Under her wide
straw hat her delicate, sensitive face and
dark blue eyes were beautiful enough to inspire
eulogy in any young man.</p>

<p>"Pardon," he said, confused by her reprimand
and her loveliness. "I shall hereafter
only <hi rend='italic'>think</hi> you are pretty, mademoiselle&mdash;mais
je ne le dirais ploo."</p>

<p>"That would be perhaps more&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>comme il
faut</hi>, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Ploo!" he repeated with emphasis. "Ploo
jamais! Je vous jure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>
<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Merci</hi>; it is not perhaps necessary to
swear quite so solemnly, monsieur."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes from the pan, moving
her small, sun-tanned hand through the heaps
of green peas, filling her palm with them and
idly letting them run through her slim fingers.</p>

<p>"L'amour," he said with an effort&mdash;"how
funny it is&mdash;isn't it, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," she replied with
decision, and rose with her pan of peas.</p>

<p>"Are you going, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have I offended you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He trailed after her down the garden path
between rows of blue larkspurs and hollyhocks&mdash;just
at her dainty heels, because the
brick walk was too narrow for both of them.</p>

<p>"Ploo," he repeated appealingly.</p>

<p>Over her shoulder she said with disdain:</p>

<p>"It is not a topic for conversation among
the young, monsieur&mdash;what you call <hi rend='italic'>l'amour</hi>."
And she entered the kitchen, where he had
not the effrontery to follow her.</p>

<p>That evening, toward sunset, returning<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
from the corral, he heard, high in the blue
sky above him, her bell-music drifting; and
involuntarily uncovering, he stood with bared
head looking upward while the celestial melody
lasted.</p>

<p>And that evening, too, being the f&ecirc;te of
Alincourt, a tiny neighbouring village across
the river, the bell-mistress went up into the
tower after dinner and played for an hour
for the little neighbour hamlet across the
river Lesse.</p>

<p>All the people who remained in Sainte
Lesse and in Alincourt brought out their
chairs and their knitting in the calm, fragrant
evening air and remained silent, sadly enraptured
while the unseen player at her keyboard
aloft in the belfry above set her carillon
music adrift under the summer stars&mdash;golden
harmonies that seemed born in the heavens
from which they floated; clear, exquisitely
sweet miracles of melody filling the world of
darkness with magic messages of hope.</p>

<p>Those widowed or childless among her listeners
for miles around in the darkness wept
quiet tears, less bitter and less hopeless for<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
the divine promise of the sky music which
filled the night as subtly as the scent of
flowers saturates the dusk.</p>

<p>Burley, listening down by the corral, leaned
against a post, one powerful hand across his
eyes, his cap clasped in the other, and in his
heart the birth of things ineffable.</p>

<p>For an hour the carillon played. Then
old Bayard struck ten times. And Burley
thought of the trenches and wondered
whether the mellow thunder of the great bell
was audible out there that night.</p>

DJACK</head>

<p>There came a day when he did not see
Maryette as he left for the corral in the
morning.</p>

<p>Her father, very stiff with rheumatism, sat
in the sun outside the arched entrance to the
inn.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "she is going to be gone all
day today. She has set and wound the drum
in the belfry so that the carillon shall play
every hour while she is absent."</p>

<p>"Where has she gone?" inquired Burley.</p>

<p>"To play the carillon at Nivelle."</p>

<p>"Nivelle!" he exclaimed sharply.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Oui, monsieur.</hi> The Mayor has asked for
her. She is to play for an hour to entertain
the wounded." He rested his withered cheek
on his hand and looked out through the win<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>dow
at the sunshine with aged and tragic
eyes. "It is very little to do for our
wounded," he added aloud to himself.</p>

<p>Burley had sent twenty mules to Nivelle
the night before, and had heard some disquieting
rumours concerning that town.</p>

<p>Now he walked out past the dusky, arched
passageway into the sunny street and continued
northward under the trees to the barracks
of the Gendarmerie.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Bon jour l'ami Gargantua!</hi>" exclaimed the
fat, jovial brigadier who had just emerged
with boots shining, pipe-clay very apparent,
and all rosy from a fresh shave.</p>

<p>"Bong joor, mon vieux copain!" replied
Burley, preoccupied with some papers he was
sorting. "Be good enough to look over my
papers."</p>

<p>The brigadier took them and examined
them.</p>

<p>"Are they <hi rend='italic'>en r&egrave;gle</hi>?" demanded Burley.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Parfaitement, mon ami.</hi>"</p>

<p>"Will they take me as far as Nivelle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But your mules went forward
last night with the Remount&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>
<p>"I know. I wish to inspect them again before
the veterinary sees them. Telephone to
the corral for a saddle mule."</p>

<p>The brigadier went inside to telephone and
Burley started for the corral at the same
time.</p>

<p>His cream-coloured, wall-eyed mule was
saddled and waiting when he arrived; he
stuffed his papers into the breast of his tunic
and climbed into the saddle.</p>

<p>"Allongs!" he exclaimed. "Hoop!"</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>Half way to Nivelle, on an overgrown,
bushy, circuitous path which was the only
road open between Nivelle and Sainte Lesse,
he overtook Maryette, driving her donkey and
ancient market cart.</p>

<p>"Carillonnette!" he called out joyously.
"Maryette! C'est je!"</p>

<p>The girl, astonished, turned her head, and
he spurred forward on his wall-eyed mount,
evincing cordial symptoms of pleasure in the
encounter.</p>

<p>"Wee, wee!" he cried. "Je voolay veneer
avec voo!" And ere the girl could protest,<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>
he had dismounted, turning the wall-eyed
one's nose southward, and had delivered a
resounding whack upon the rump of that
temperamental animal.</p>

<p>"Allez! Go home! Beat it!" he cried.</p>

<p>The mule lost no time but headed for the
distant corral at a canter; and Burley, grinning
like a great, splendid, intelligent dog
who has just done something to be proud of,
stepped into the market cart and seated himself
beside Maryette.</p>

<p>"Who told you where I am going?" she
asked, scarcely knowing whether to laugh or
let loose her indignation.</p>

<p>"Your father, Carillonnette."</p>

<p>"Why did you follow me?"</p>

<p>"I had nothing else to do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that the reason?"</p>

<p>"I like to be with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, monsieur! And you think it was
not necessary to consult my wishes?"</p>

<p>"Don't you like to be with me?" he asked,
so na&iuml;vely that the girl blushed and bit her
lip and shook the reins without replying.</p>

<p>They jogged on through the disused by<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>way,
the filbert bushes brushing axle and
traces; but presently the little donkey relapsed
into a walk again, and the girl, who
had counted on that procedure when she
started from Sainte Lesse, did not urge him.</p>

<p>"Also," she said in a low voice, "I have
been wondering who permits you to address
me as Carillonnette. Also as Maryette. You
have been, heretofore, quite correct in assuming
that mademoiselle is the proper form of
address."</p>

<p>"I was so glad to see you," he said, so simply
that she flushed again and offered no further
comment.</p>

<p>For a long while she let him do the talking,
which was perfectly agreeable to him.
He talked on every subject he could think of,
frankly practicing idioms on her, pleased with
his own fluency and his progress in French.</p>

<p>After a while she said, looking around at
him with a curiosity quite friendly:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Monsieur Burley, <hi rend='italic'>why</hi> did you
desire to come with me today?"</p>

<p>He started to reply, but checked himself,
looking into the dark blue and engaging eyes.<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
After a moment the engaging eyes became
brilliantly serious.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she repeated. "Is it because
there were some rumours last evening concerning
Nivelle?"</p>

<p>"Wee!"</p>

<p>"Oh," she nodded, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>After driving for a little while in silence
she looked around at him with an expression
on her face which altered it exquisitely.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," she murmured....
"And if you wish to call me Carillonnette&mdash;do
so."</p>

<p>"I do want to. And my name's Jack....
If you don't mind."</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on her donkey's ears.</p>

<p>"Djack," she repeated, musingly. "Jacques&mdash;Djack&mdash;it's
the same, isn't it&mdash;Djack?"</p>

<p>He turned red and she laughed at him, no
longer afraid.</p>

<p>"Listen, my friend," she said, "it is <hi rend='italic'>tr&egrave;s
beau</hi>&mdash;what have you done."</p>

<p>"Vooz &ecirc;tes tray belle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Non!</hi> Please stop! It is not a question
of me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
<p>"Vooz &ecirc;tes tray chick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, Djack! That is not good manners!
No! I was merely saying that&mdash;you have
done something very nice. Which is quite
true. You heard rumours that Nivelle had
become unsafe. People whispered last evening&mdash;something
about the danger of a salient
being cut at its base.... I heard the gossip
in the street. Was that why you came
after me?"</p>

<p>"Wee."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Djack."</p>

<p>She leaned a trifle forward in the cart, her
dimpled elbows on her knees, the reins sagging.</p>

<p>Blue and rosy jays flew up before them,
fluttering away through the thickets; a bullfinch
whistled sweetly from a thorn bush,
watching them pass under him, unafraid.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, half to herself, "I <hi rend='italic'>had</hi>
to come. Who could refuse our wounded?
There is no bell-master in our department;
and only one bell-mistress.... To find anyone
else to play the Nivelle carillon one would
have to pierce the barbarians' lines and search<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>
the ruins of Flanders for a <hi rend='italic'>Beiaardier</hi>&mdash;a
<hi rend='italic'>Klokkenist</hi>, as they call a carillonneur in the
low countries.... But the Mayor asked it,
and our wounded are waiting. You understand,
<hi rend='italic'>mon ami</hi> Djack, I had to come."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>She added, na&iuml;vely:</p>

<p>"God watches over our trenches. We shall
be quite safe in Nivelle."</p>

<p>A dull boom shook the sunlit air. Even in
the cart they could feel the vibration.</p>

<p>An hour later, everywhere ahead of them,
a vast, confused thundering was steadily increasing,
deepening with every ominous reverberation.</p>

<p>Where two sandy wood roads crossed, a
mounted gendarme halted them and examined
their papers.</p>

<p>"My poor child," he said to the girl, shaking
his head, "the wounded at Nivelle were
taken away during the night. They are
fighting there now in the streets."</p>

<p>"In Nivelle streets!" faltered the girl.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Oui, mademoiselle.</hi> Of the carillon little
remains. The Boches have been shelling it<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>
since daylight. Turn again. And it is better
that you turn quickly, because it is not known
to us what is going on in that wooded district
over there. For if they get a foothold in
Nivelle on this drive they might cross this
road before evening."</p>

<p>The girl sat grief-stricken and silent in the
cart, staring at the woods ahead where the
road ran through taller saplings and where,
here and there, mature trees towered.</p>

<p>All around them now the increasing thunder
rolled and echoed and shook the ground
under them. Half a dozen gendarmes came
up at a gallop. Their officer drew bridle,
seized the donkey's head and turned animal
and cart southward.</p>

<p>"Go back," he said briefly, recognizing Burley
and returning his salute. "You may have
to take your mules out of Sainte Lesse!" he
added, as he wheeled his horse. "We are
getting into trouble out here, <hi rend='italic'>nom de Dieu</hi>!"</p>

<p>Maryette's head hung as the donkey jogged
along, trotting willingly because his nose was
now pointed homeward.</p>

<p>The girl drove with loose and careless rein<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>
and in silence; and beside her sat Burley, his
troubled gaze always reverting to the despondent
form beside him.</p>

<p>"Too bad, little girl," he said. "But another
time our wounded shall listen to your
carillon."</p>

<p>"Never at Nivelle.... The belfry is being
destroyed.... The sweetest carillon in
France&mdash;the oldest, the most beautiful....
Fifty-six bells, Djack&mdash;a wondrous wilderness
of bells rising above where one stands in the
belfry, tier on tier, tier on tier, until one's
gaze is lost amid the heavenly company aloft....
Oh, Djack! And the great bell, Clovis!
He hangs there&mdash;through hundreds of years
he has spoken with his great voice of God!&mdash;so
that they heard him for miles and miles
across the land&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maryette&mdash;I am so sorry for you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! My carillon of Nivelle! My
beloved carillon!"</p>

<p>"Maryette, dear! My little Carillonnette&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;my heart is broken&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vooz ates tray, tray belle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>
<p>The sudden crashing of heavy feet in the
bushes checked him; but it was too late to
heed it now&mdash;too late to reach for his holster.
For all around them swarmed the men in sea-grey,
jerking the donkey off his forelegs,
blocking the little wheels with great, dirty
fists, seizing Burley from behind and dragging
him violently out of the cart.</p>

<p>A near-sighted officer, thin and spare as
Death, was talking in a loud, nasal voice and
squinting at Burley where he still struggled,
red and exasperated, in the clutches of four
soldiers:</p>

<p>"Also! That is no uniform known to us
or to any nation at war with us. That is not
regulation in England&mdash;that collar insignia.
This is a case of a franc-tireur! Now, then,
you there in your costume de fantasie! What
have you to say, eh?"</p>

<p>There was a silence; Burley ceased struggling.</p>

<p>"Answer, do you hear? What are you?"</p>

<p>"American."</p>

<p>"Pig-dog!" shouted the gaunt officer. "So
you are one of those Yankee muleteers in<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>
your uniform, and armed! It is sufficient that
you are American. If it had not been for
America this war would be ended! But it is
not enough, apparently, that you come here
with munitions and food, that you insult us
at sea, that you lie about us and slander us
and send your shells and cartridges to England
to slay our people! No! Also you must
come to insult us in your clown's uniform and
with your pistol&mdash;" The man began to choke
with fury, unable to continue, except by
gesture.</p>

<p>But the jerky gestures were terribly significant:
soldiers were already pushing Burley
across the road toward a great oak tree;
six men fell out and lined up.</p>

<p>"M-my Government&mdash;" stammered the
young fellow&mdash;but was given no opportunity
to speak. Very white, the chill sweat standing
on his forehead and under his eyes, he
stood against the oak, lips compressed, grey
eyes watching what was happening to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he understood it was all over.</p>

<p>"Djack!"</p>

<p>He turned his gaze toward Maryette, where<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>
she struggled toward him, held by two soldiers.</p>

<p>"Maryette&mdash;Carillonnette&mdash;" His voice suddenly
became steady, perfectly clear. "<hi rend='italic'>Je
vous aime</hi>, Carillonnette."</p>

<p>"Oh, Djack! Djack!" she cried in terror.</p>

<p>He heard the orders; was aware of the
levelled rifles; but his reckless greyish eyes
were now fixed on her, and he began to laugh
almost mischievously.</p>

<p>"Vooz &ecirc;tes tray belle," he said, "&mdash;tray,
tray chick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Djack!"</p>

<p>But the clang of the volley precluded any
response from him except the half tender,
half reckless smile that remained on his youthful
face where he lay looking up at the sky
with pleasant, sightless eyes, and a sunbeam
touching the metal mule on his blood-wet
collar.</p>

FRIENDSHIP</head>

<p>She tried once more to lift the big, warm,
flexible body, exerting all her slender strength.
It was useless. It was like attempting to lift
the earth. The weight of the body frightened
her.</p>

<p>Again she sank down among the ferns
under the great oak tree; once more she took
his blood-smeared head on her lap, smoothing
the bright, wet hair; and her tears fell
slowly upon his upturned face.</p>

<p>"My friend," she stammered, "&mdash;my kind,
droll friend.... The first friend I ever
had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The gun thunder beyond Nivelle had ceased;
an intense stillness reigned in the forest; only
a leaf moved here and there on the aspens.</p>

<p>A few forest flies whirled about her, but<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>
as yet no ominous green flies came&mdash;none of
those jewelled harbingers of death which appear
with horrible promptness and as though
by magic from nowhere when anything dies
in the open world.</p>

<p>Her donkey, still attached to the little gaily
painted market cart, had wandered on up the
sandy lane, feeding at random along the fern-bordered
thickets which walled in the Nivelle
byroad on either side.</p>

<p>Presently her ear caught a slight sound;
something stirred somewhere in the woods
behind her. After an interval of terrible
stillness there came a distant crashing of
footsteps among dead leaves and underbrush.</p>

<p>Horror of the Hun still possessed her; the
victim of Prussian ferocity still lay across
her knees. She dared not take the chance
that friendly ears might hear her call for aid&mdash;dared
not raise her voice in appeal lest she
awaken something monstrous, unclean, inconceivable&mdash;the
unseen thing which she could
hear at intervals prowling there among dead
leaves in the demi-light of the woods.</p>

<p>Suddenly her heart leaped with fright; a<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
man stepped cautiously out of the woods into
the road; another, dressed in leather, with
dry blood caked on his face, followed.</p>

<p>The first comer, a French gendarme, had
already caught sight of the donkey and market
cart; had turned around instinctively to
look for their owner. Now he discovered her
seated there among the ferns under the oak
tree.</p>

<p>"In the name of God," he growled, "what's
that child doing there!"</p>

<p>The airman in leather followed him across
the road to the oak; the girl looked up at
them out of dark, tear-marred eyes that
seemed dazed.</p>

<p>"Well, little one!" rumbled the big, red-faced
gendarme. "What's your name?&mdash;you
who sit here all alone at the wood's edge with
a dead man across your knees?"</p>

<p>She made an effort to find her voice&mdash;to
control it.</p>

<p>"I am Maryette Courtray, bell-mistress of
Sainte Lesse," she answered, trembling.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;this young man?"</p>

<p>"They shot him&mdash;the Prussians, monsieur."<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/></p>

<p>"My poor child! Was he your lover, then?"</p>

<p>Her tear-filled eyes widened:</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said na&iuml;vely; "it is sadder
than that. He was my friend."</p>

<p>The big gendarme scratched his chin; then,
with an odd glance at the young airman who
stood beside him:</p>

<p>"To lose a friend is indeed sadder than to
lose a lover. What was your friend's name,
little one?"</p>

<p>She pressed her hand to her forehead in
an effort to search among her partly paralyzed
thoughts:</p>

<p>"Djack.... That is his name.... He was
the first real friend I ever had."</p>

<p>The airman said:</p>

<p>"He is one of my countrymen&mdash;an American
muleteer, Jack Burley&mdash;in charge at
Sainte Lesse."</p>

<p>At the sound of the young man's name pronounced
in English the girl began to cry. The
big gendarme bent over and patted her cheek.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Allons</hi>," he growled; "courage! little mistress
of the bells! Let us place your friend<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>

in your pretty market cart and leave this
accursed place, in God's name!"</p>

<p>He straightened up and looked over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"For the Boches are in Nivelle woods," he
added, with an oath, "and we ought to be on
our way to Sainte Lesse, if we are to arrive
there at all. <hi rend='italic'>Allons</hi>, comrade, take him by
the head!"</p>

<p>So the wounded airman bent over and took
the body by the shoulders; the gendarme
lifted the feet; the little bell-mistress followed,
holding to one of the sagging arms, as
though fearing that these strangers might
take away from her this dead man who had
been so much more to her than a mere lover.</p>

<p>When they laid him in the market cart she
released his sleeve with a sob. Still crying,
she climbed to the seat of the cart and gathered
up the reins. Behind her, flat on the
floor of the cart, the airman and the gendarme
had seated themselves, with the young man's
body between them. They were opening his
tunic and shirt now and were whispering to<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>gether,
and wiping away blood from the naked
shoulders and chest.</p>

<p>"He's still warm, but there's no pulse,"
whispered the airman. "He's dead enough, I
guess, but I'd rather hear a surgeon say so."</p>

<p>The gendarme rose, stepped across to the
seat, took the reins gently from the girl.</p>

<p>"Weep peacefully, little one," he said; "it
does one good. Tears are the tisane which
strengthens the soul."</p>

<p>"Ye-es.... But I am remembering that&mdash;that
I was not very k-kind to him," she
sobbed. "It hurts&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>here</hi>&mdash;" She pressed a
slim hand over her breast.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Allons!</hi> Friends quarrel. God understands.
Thy friend back there&mdash;he also understands
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope he does!... He spoke to me
so tenderly&mdash;yet so gaily. He was even
laughing at me when they shot him. He was
so kind&mdash;and droll&mdash;" She sobbed anew,
clasping her hands and pressing them against
her quivering mouth to check her grief.</p>

<p>"Was it an execution, then?" demanded the
gendarme in his growling voice.<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/></p>

<p>"They said he must be a franc-tireur to
wear such a uniform&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, the scoundrels! Ah, the assassins!
And so they murdered him there under the
tree?"</p>

<p>"Ah, God! Yes! I seem to see him standing
there now&mdash;his grey, kind eyes&mdash;and no
thought of fear&mdash;just a droll smile&mdash;the way
he had with me&mdash;" whispered the girl, "the
way&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>his</hi> way&mdash;with me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Child," said the gendarme, pityingly, "it
<hi rend='italic'>was</hi> love!"</p>

<p>But she shook her head, surprised, the tears
still running down her tanned cheeks:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, it was more serious than love;
it was friendship."</p>

THE AVIATOR</head>

<p>Where the Fontanes highroad crosses the
byroad to Sainte Lesse they were halted by
a dusty column moving rapidly west&mdash;four
hundred American mules convoyed by gendarmerie
and remount troopers.</p>

<p>The sweating riders, passing at a canter,
shouted from their saddles to the big gendarme
in the market cart that neither Nivelle
nor Sainte Lesse were to be defended at present,
and that all stragglers were being directed
to Fontanes and Le Marronnier. Mules
and drivers defiled at a swinging trot, enveloped
in torrents of white dust; behind them
rode a peloton of the remount, lashing recalcitrant
animals forward; and in the rear of
these rolled automobile ambulances, red
crosses aglow in the rays of the setting sun.<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/></p>

<p>The driver of the last ambulance seemed
to be ill; his head lay on the shoulder of a
Sister of Charity who had taken the steering
wheel.</p>

<p>The gendarme beside Maryette signalled
her to stop; then he got out of the market
cart and, lifting the body of the American
muleteer in his powerful arms, strode across
the road. The airman leaped from the market
cart and followed him.</p>

<p>Between them they drew out a stretcher,
laid the muleteer on it, and shoved it back
into the vehicle.</p>

<p>There was a brief consultation, then they
both came back to Maryette, who, rigid in her
seat and very pale, sat watching the procedure
in silence.</p>

<p>The gendarme said:</p>

<p>"I go to Fontanes. There's a dressing station
on the road. It appears that your young
man's heart hasn't quite stopped yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl rose excitedly to her feet, but the
gendarme gently forced her back into her seat
and laid the reins in her hands. To the airman
he growled:<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/></p>

<p>"I did not tell this poor child to hope; I
merely informed her that her friend yonder
is still breathing. But he's as full of holes
as a pepper pot!" He frowned at Maryette:
"<hi rend='italic'>Allons!</hi> My comrade here goes to Sainte
Lesse. Drive him there now, in God's name,
before the Uhlans come clattering on your
heels!"</p>

<p>He turned, strode away to the ambulance
once more, climbed in, and placed one big arm
around the sick driver's shoulder, drawing the
man's head down against his breast.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Bonne chance!</hi>" he called back to the airman,
who had now seated himself beside
Maryette. "Explain to our little bell-mistress
that we're taking her friend to a place where
they fool Death every day&mdash;where to cheat
the grave is a flourishing business! Good-bye!
Courage! En route, brave Sister of the
World!"</p>

<p>The Sister of Charity turned and smiled at
Maryette, made her a friendly gesture, threw
in the clutch, and, twisting the steering wheel
with both sun-browned hands, guided the ma<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>chine
out onto the road and sped away swiftly
after the cloud of receding dust.</p>

<p>"Drive on, mademoiselle," said the airman
quietly.</p>

<p>In his accent there was something poignantly
familiar to Maryette, and she turned
with a start and looked at him out of her
dark blue, tear-marred eyes.</p>

<p>"Are <hi rend='italic'>you</hi> also American?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Gunner observer, American air squadron,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"An airman?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My machine was shot down in Nivelle
woods an hour ago."</p>

<p>After a silence, as they jogged along between
the hazel thickets in the warm afternoon
sunshine:</p>

<p>"Were you acquainted with my friend?"
she asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"With Jack Burley? A little. I knew him
in Calais."</p>

<p>The tears welled up into her eyes:</p>

<p>"Could you tell me about him?... He was
my first friend.... I did not understand him
in the beginning, monsieur. Among children<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>
it is different; I had known boys&mdash;as one
knows them at school. But a man, never&mdash;and,
indeed, I had not thought I had grown
up until&mdash;he came&mdash;Djack&mdash;to live at our inn....
The White Doe at Sainte Lesse, monsieur.
My father keeps it."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded the airman gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that is the way. He came&mdash;my first
friend, Djack&mdash;with mules from America, monsieur&mdash;one
thousand mules. And God knows
Sainte Lesse had never seen the like! As for
me&mdash;I thought I was a child still&mdash;until&mdash;do
you understand, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Maryette."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is how I found I was grown up.
He was a man, not a boy&mdash;that is how I found
out. So he became my first friend. He was
quite droll, and very big and kind&mdash;and timid&mdash;following
me about&mdash;oh, it was quite droll
for both of us, because at first I was afraid,
but pretended not to be."</p>

<p>She smiled, then suddenly her eyes filled
with the tragedy again, and she began to
whimper softly to herself, with a faint sound
like a hovering pigeon.<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/></p>

<p>"Tell me about him," said the airman.</p>

<p>She staunched her tears with the edge of
her apron.</p>

<p>"It was that way with us," she managed to
say. "I was enchanted and a little frightened&mdash;it
being my first friendship. He was so big,
so droll, so kind.... We were on our way
to Nivelle this morning. I was to play the
carillon&mdash;being mistress of the bells at Sainte
Lesse&mdash;and there was nobody else to play the
bells at Nivelle; and the wounded desired to
hear the carillon."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So Djack came after me&mdash;hearing rumours
of Prussians in that direction. They were
true&mdash;oh, God!&mdash;and the Prussians caught us
there where you found us."</p>

<p>She bowed her supple figure double on the
seat, covering her face with her sun-browned
hands.</p>

<p>The airman drove on, whistling "La Braban&ccedil;onne"
under his breath, and deep in
thought. From time to time he glanced at
the curved figure beside him; but he said no
more for a long time.<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/></p>

<p>Toward sunset they drove into the Sainte
Lesse highway.</p>

<p>He spoke abruptly, dryly:</p>

<p>"Anybody can weep for a friend. But few
avenge their dead."</p>

<p>She looked up, bewildered.</p>

<p>They drove under the old Sainte Lesse gate
as he spoke. The sunlight lay pink across the
walls and tipped the turret of the watch tower
with fire.</p>

<p>The town seemed very still; nothing was
to be seen on the long main street except here
and there a Spahi horseman <hi rend='italic'>en vidette</hi>, and
the clock-tower pigeons circling in their evening
flight.</p>

<p>The girl, Maryette, looked dumbly into the
fading daylight when the cart stopped before
her door. The airman took her gently by
the arm, and that awakened her. As though
stiffened by fatigue she rose and climbed to
the sidewalk. He took her unresisting arm
and led her through the tunnelled wall and
into the White Doe Inn.</p>

<p>"Get me some supper," he said. "It will
take your mind off your troubles."<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Bread, wine, and some meat, if you have
any. I'll be back in a few moments."</p>

<p>He left her at the inn door and went out
into the street, whistling "La Braban&ccedil;onne."
A cavalryman directed him to the military
telephone installed in the house of the notary
across the street.</p>

<p>His papers identified him; the operator
gave him his connection; they switched him
to the headquarters of his air squadron, where
he made his report.</p>

<p>"Shot down?" came the sharp exclamation
over the wire.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, about eleven-thirty this morning
on the north edge of Nivelle forest."</p>

<p>"The machine?"</p>

<p>"Done for, sir. They have it."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"A scratch&mdash;nothing. I had to run."</p>

<p>"What else have you to report?"</p>

<p>The airman made his brief report in an
unemotional voice. Ending it, he asked permission
to volunteer for a special service.
And for ten minutes the officer at the other<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>
end of the wire listened to a proposition which
interested him intensely.</p>

<p>When the airman finished, the officer said:</p>

<p>"Wait till I relay this matter."</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour the airman waited.
Finally the operator half turned on his camp
chair and made a gesture for him to resume
the receiver.</p>

<p>"If you choose to volunteer for such service,"
came the message, "it is approved. But understand&mdash;you
are not ordered on such duty."</p>

<p>"I understand. I volunteer."</p>

<p>"Very well. Munitions go to you immediately
by automobile. It is expected that the
wind will blow from the west by morning.
By morning, also, all reserves will arrive in
the west salient. What is to be your signal?"</p>

<p>"The carillon from the Nivelle belfry."</p>

<p>"What tune?"</p>

<p>"'La Braban&ccedil;onne.' If not that, then the
tocsin on the great bell, Clovis."</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>In the tiny caf&eacute; the crippled innkeeper sat,
his aged, wistful eyes watching three leather-<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>clad
airmen who had been whispering together
around a table in the corner all the afternoon.</p>

<p>They nodded in silence to the new arrival,
and he joined them.</p>

<p>Daylight faded in the room; the drum in
the Sainte Lesse belfry, set to play before
the hour sounded, began to turn aloft; the
silvery notes of the carillon seemed to shower
down from the sky, filling the twilight world
with angelic melody. Then, in resonant
beauty, the great bell, Bayard, measured the
hour.</p>

<p>The airman who had just arrived went to a
sink, washed the caked blood from his face
and tied it up with a first-aid bandage. Then
he began to pace the caf&eacute;, his head bent in
thought, his nervous hands clasped behind
him.</p>

<p>The room was dusky when he came back
to the table where his three comrades still
sat consulting in whispers. The old innkeeper
had fallen asleep on his chair by the
window. There was no light in the room except
what came from stars.<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/></p>

<p>"Well," said one of the airmen in a carefully
modulated voice, "what are you going
to do, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Stay."</p>

<p>"What's the idea?"</p>

<p>The bandaged airman rested both hands on
the stained table-top:</p>

<p>"We quit Nivelle tonight, but our reserves
are already coming up and we are to retake
Nivelle tomorrow. You flew over the town
this morning, didn't you?"</p>

<p>All three said yes.</p>

<p>"You took photographs?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then you know that our trenches pass
under the bell-tower?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well. The wind is north. When the
Boches enter our trenches they'll try to gas
our salient while the wind holds. But west
winds are predicted after sunrise tomorrow.
I'm going to get into the Nivelle belfry tonight
with a sack of bombs. I'm going to try
to explode their gas cylinders if I can. The<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>
tocsin is the signal for our people in the
salient."</p>

<p>"You're crazy!" remarked one of the airmen.</p>

<p>"No; I'll bluff it out. I'm to have a Boche
uniform in a few moments."</p>

<p>"You <hi rend='italic'>are</hi> crazy! You know what they'll do
to you, don't you, Jim?"</p>

<p>The bandaged airman laughed, but in his
eyes there was an odd flicker like a tiny flame.
He whistled "La Braban&ccedil;onne" and glanced
coolly about the room.</p>

<p>One of the airmen said to another in a
whisper:</p>

<p>"There you are. Ever since they got his
brother he's been figuring on landing a whole
bunch of Huns at one clip. This is going to
finish him, this business."</p>

<p>Another said:</p>

<p>"Don't try anything like that, Jim&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll try it," interrupted the bandaged
airman pleasantly. "When are you fellows
going?"</p>

<p>"Now."<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/></p>

<p>"All right. Take my report. Wait a moment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Jim, act sensibly!"</p>

<p>The bandaged airman laughed, fished out
from his clothing somewhere a note book and
pencil. One of the others turned an electric
torch on the table; the bandaged man made
a little sketch, wrote a few lines which the
others studied.</p>

<p>"You can get that note to headquarters in
half an hour, can't you, Ed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll wait here for my answer."</p>

<p>"You know what risk you run, Jim?"
pleaded the youngest of the airmen.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. All right, then. You'd better
be on your way."</p>

<p>After they had left the room, the bandaged
airman sat beside the table, thinking hard in
the darkness.</p>

<p>Presently from somewhere across the dusky
river meadow the sudden roar of an airplane
engine shattered the silence; then another
whirring racket broke out; then another.</p>

<p>He heard presently the loud rattle of his<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>
comrades' machines from high above him in
the star-set sky; he heard the stertorous
breathing of the old innkeeper; he heard again
the crystalline bell-notes break out aloft, linger
in linked harmonies, die away; he heard
Bayard's mellow thunder proclaim the hour
once more.</p>

<p>There was a watch on his wrist, but it had
been put out of business when his machine
fell in Nivelle woods. Glancing at it mechanically
he saw the phosphorescent dial glimmer
faintly under shattered hands that remained
fixed.</p>

<p>An hour later Bayard shook the starlit
silence ten times.</p>

<p>As the last stroke boomed majestically
through the darkness an automobile came racing
into the long, unlighted street of Sainte
Lesse and halted, panting, at the door of the
White Doe Inn.</p>

<p>The airman went out to the doorstep, saluted
the staff captain who leaned forward
from the tonneau and turned a flash on him.
Then, satisfied, the officer lifted a bundle from<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>
the tonneau and handed it to the airman. A
letter was pinned to the bundle.</p>

<p>After the airman had read the letter twice,
the staff captain leaned a trifle nearer.</p>

<p>"Do you think it can be done?" he demanded
bluntly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Here are your munitions, too."</p>

<p>He lifted from the tonneau a bomb-thrower's
sack, heavy and full. The airman took
it and saluted.</p>

<p>"It means the cross," said the staff captain
dryly. And to the engineer chauffeur: "Let
loose!"</p>

HONOUR</head>

<p>For a moment the airman stood watching
and listening. The whir of the receding car
died away in the night.</p>

<p>Then, carrying his bundle and his bomber's
sack, heavy with latent death, he went into
the inn and through the caf&eacute;, where the sleeping
innkeeper sat huddled, and felt his way
cautiously to the little dining room.</p>

<p>The wooden shutters had been closed; a
candle flared on the table. Maryette sat beside
it, her arms extended across the cloth,
her head bowed.</p>

<p>He thought she was asleep, but she looked
up as his footfall sounded on the bare floor.</p>

<p>She was so pale that he asked her if she
felt ill.<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/></p>

<p>"No. I have been thinking of my friend,"
she replied in a low but steady voice.</p>

<p>"He may live," said the airman. "He was
alive when we lifted him."</p>

<p>The girl nodded as though preoccupied&mdash;an
odd, mysterious little nod, as though assenting
to some intimate, inward suggestion
of her own mind.</p>

<p>Then she raised her dark blue eyes to the
airman, who was still standing beside the
table, the sack of bombs hanging from his
left shoulder, the bundle under his arm.</p>

<p>"Here is supper," she said, looking around
absently at the few dishes. Then she folded
her hands on the table's edge and sat silent,
as though lost in thought.</p>

<p>He placed the sack carefully on a cane chair
beside him, the bundle on the floor, and seated
himself opposite her. There was bread, meat,
and a bottle of red wine. The girl declined
to eat, saying that she had supped.</p>

<p>"Your friend Jack," he said again, after a
long silence, "&mdash;I have seen worse cases. He
may live, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"That," she said musingly, in her low, even<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>
voice, "is now in God's hands." She gave
the slightest movement to her shoulders, as
though easing them a trifle of that burden.
"I have prayed. You saw me weep. That is
ended&mdash;so much. Now&mdash;" and across her eyes
shot a blue gleam, "&mdash;now I am ready to listen
to <hi rend='italic'>you</hi>! In the cart&mdash;out on the road
there&mdash;you said that anybody can weep, but
that few dare avenge."</p>

<p>"Yes," he drawled, "I said that."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; tell me <hi rend='italic'>how</hi>!"</p>

<p>"What do <hi rend='italic'>you</hi> want to avenge? Your
friend?"</p>

<p>"His country's honour, and mine! If he
had been slain&mdash;otherwise&mdash;I should have perhaps
mourned him, confident in the law of
France. But&mdash;I have seen the Rhenish swine
on French soil&mdash;I saw the Boches do this
thing in France. It is not merely my friend
I desire to avenge; it is the triple crime
against his life, against the honour of his
country and of mine." She had not raised
her voice; had not stirred in her chair.</p>

<p>The airman, who had stopped eating, sat<pb n='229'/><anchor id='Pg229'/>
with fork in hand, listening, regarding her
intently.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, resuming his meal, "I understand
quite well what you mean. Some such
philosophy sent my elder brother and me over
here from New York&mdash;the wild hogs trampling
through Belgium&mdash;the ferocious herds from
the Rhine defacing, defiling, rending, obliterating
all that civilized man has reverenced for
centuries.... That's the idea&mdash;the world-wide
menace of these unclean hordes&mdash;and
the murderous filth of them!... They got
my brother."</p>

<p>He shrugged, realizing that his face had
flushed with the heat of inner fires.</p>

<p>"Coolness does it," he added, almost apologetically,
"&mdash;method and coolness. The world
must keep its head clear: yellow fever and
smallpox have been nearly stamped out; the
Hun can be eliminated&mdash;with intelligence and
clear thinking.... And I'm only an American
airman who has been shot down like a
winged heron whose comrades have lingered a
little to comfort him and have gone on....
Yes, but a winged heron can still stab, little<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>

mistress of the bells.... And every blow
counts.... Listen attentively&mdash;for Jack's sake ... and
for the sake of France. For I am
going to explain to you how you can strike&mdash;if
you want to."</p>

<p>"I am listening," said Maryette serenely.</p>

<p>"We may not live through it. Even my
orders do not send me to do this thing; they
merely permit it. Are you contented to go
with me?"</p>

<p>She nodded, the shadow of a smile on her
lips.</p>

<p>"Very well. You play the carillon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You can play 'La Braban&ccedil;onne'?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On the bells?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He rose, went around the table, carrying
his chair with him, and seated himself beside
her. She inclined her pale, pretty head; he
placed his lips close to her ear, speaking very
slowly and distinctly, explaining his plan in
every minute detail.</p>

<p>While he was still speaking in a whisper,<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>
the street outside filled with the trample of
arriving cavalry. The Spahis were leaving
the environs of Sainte Lesse; <hi rend='italic'>chasseurs &agrave;
cheval</hi> followed from still farther afield, escorting
ambulances from the Nivelle hospitals
now being abandoned.</p>

<p>"The trenches at Nivelle are being emptied,"
said the airman.</p>

<p>"And do you mean that you and I are to
go there, to Nivelle?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean. In an hour
I shall be in the Nivelle belfry. Will you be
there with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he exclaimed. "You can play
'La Braban&ccedil;onne' on the bells while I blow
hell out of them in the redoubt below us!"</p>

<p>The infantry from the Nivelle trenches began
to pass. There were a few wagons, a
battery of seventy-fives, a soup kitchen or two
and a long column of mules from Fontanes.</p>

<p>Two American muleteers knocked at the
inn door and came stamping into the hallway,
asking for a loaf and a bottle of red wine.
Maryette rose from the table to find pro<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>visions;
the airman got up also, saying in
English:</p>

<p>"Where do you come from, boys?"</p>

<p>"From Fontanes corral," they replied, surprised
to hear their own tongue spoken.</p>

<p>"Do you know Jack Burley, one of your
people?"</p>

<p>"Sure. He's just been winged bad."</p>

<p>"The Huns done him up something fierce,"
added the other.</p>

<p>"Very bad?"</p>

<p>Maryette came back with a loaf and two
bottles.</p>

<p>"I seen him at Fontanes," replied the muleteer,
taking the provisions from the girl.
"He's all shot to pieces, but they say he'll pull
through."</p>

<p>The airman turned to Maryette:</p>

<p>"Jack will get well," he translated bluntly.</p>

<p>The girl, who had just refused the money
offered by the American muleteer, turned
sharply, became deadly white for a second,
then her face flamed with a hot and splendid
colour.</p>

<p>One of the muleteers said:<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/></p>

<p>"Is this here his girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the airman.</p>

<p>The muleteer became voluble, patting Maryette
on one arm and then on the other:</p>

<p>"J'ai vue Jack Burley, mamzelle, toot a
l'heure! Il est bien, savvy voo! Il est tray,
tray bien! Bocoo de trou! N'importe! <corr sic='I&apos;l'>Il</corr>
va tray bien! Savvy voo? Jack Burley, l'ami
de voo! Comprenny? On va le guerir toot
sweet! Wee! Wee! Wee!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl flung her arms around the amazed
muleteer's neck and kissed him impetuously
on both cheeks. The muleteer blushed and
his comrade fidgeted. Only the girl remained
unembarrassed.</p>

<p>Half laughing, half crying, terribly excited,
and very lovely to look upon, she caught both
muleteers by their sleeves and poured out a
torrent of questions. With the airman's aid
she extracted what information they had to
offer; and they went their way, flustered, still
blushing, clasping bread and bottles to their
agitated breasts.</p>

<p>The airman looked her keenly in the eyes
as she came back from the door, still intensely<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>
excited, adorably transfigured. She opened
her lips to speak&mdash;the happy exclamation on
her lips, already half uttered, died there.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired the airman quietly.</p>

<p>Dumb, still breathing rapidly, she returned
his gaze in silence.</p>

<p>"Now that your friend Jack is going to live&mdash;what
next?" asked the airman pleasantly.</p>

<p>For a full minute she continued to stare at
him without a word.</p>

<p>"No need to avenge him now," added the
airman, watching her.</p>

<p>"No." She turned, gazed vaguely into
space. After a moment she said, as though
to herself: "But his country's honour&mdash;and
mine? That reckoning still remains! Is it
not true?"</p>

<p>The airman said, with a trace of pity in his
voice, for the girl seemed very young:</p>

<p>"You need not go with me to Nivelle just
because you promised."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said simply, "I must go, of
course&mdash;it being a question of our country's
honour."</p>

<p>"I do not ask it. Nor would Jack, your<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>
friend. Nor would your own country ask it
of you, Maryette Courtray."</p>

<p>She replied serenely:</p>

<p>"But <hi rend='italic'>I</hi> ask it&mdash;of <hi rend='italic'>myself</hi>. Do you understand,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly." He glanced mechanically at
his useless wrist watch, then inquired the
time. She went to her room, returned, wearing
a little jacket and carrying a pair of big,
wooden gloves.</p>

<p>"It is after eleven o'clock," she said. "I
brought my jacket because it is cold in all
belfries. It will be cold in Nivelle, up there
in the tower under Clovis."</p>

<p>"You really mean to go with me?"</p>

<p>She did not even trouble to reply to the
question. So he picked up his packet and his
sack of bombs, and they went out, side by
side, under the tunnelled wall.</p>

<p>Infantry from Nivelle trenches were still
plodding along the dark street under the
trees; dull gleams came from their helmets
and bayonets in the obscure light of the stars.</p>

<p>The girl stood watching them for a few<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>

moments, then her hand sought the airman's
arm:</p>

<p>"If there is to be a battle in the street here,
my father cannot remain."</p>

<p>The airman nodded, went out into the street
and spoke to a passing officer. He, in turn,
signalled the driver of a motor omnibus to
halt.</p>

<p>The little bell-mistress entered the tavern,
followed by two soldiers. In a few moments
they came out bearing, chair-fashion between
them, the crippled innkeeper.</p>

<p>The old man was much alarmed, but his
daughter followed beside him to the omnibus,
in which were several lamed soldiers.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Et toi?</hi>" he quavered as they lifted him
in. "What of thee, Maryette?"</p>

<p>"I follow," she called out cheerily. "I rejoin
thee&mdash;" the bus moved on&mdash;"God knows
when or where!" she added under her breath.</p>

<p>The airman was whispering to a fat staff
officer when she rejoined him. All three
looked up in silence at the belfry of Sainte
Lesse, looming above them, a monstrous
shadow athwart the stars. A moment later<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>
an automobile, arriving from the south, drew
up in front of the inn.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Bonne chance</hi>," said the fat officer
abruptly; he turned and waddled swiftly away
in the darkness. They saw him mount his
horse. His legs stuck out sideways.</p>

<p>"Now," whispered the airman, with a nod
to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The little bell-mistress entered the car, her
wooden gloves tucked under one arm. The
airman followed with his packet and his sack
of bombs. The chauffeur started his engine.</p>

<p>The middle of the road was free to him;
the edges were occupied by the retreating infantry.
As the car started, very slowly, cautiously
feeling its way out of Sainte Lesse,
the fat staff officer turned his horse and
trotted up alongside. The car stopped, the
engine still running.</p>

<p>"It's understood?" asked the officer in a low
voice. "It's to be when we hear 'La Braban&ccedil;onne'?"</p>

<p>"When you hear 'La Braban&ccedil;onne.'"</p>

<p>"Understood," said the staff officer crisply,
saluted and drew bridle. And the car moved<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>

out into the starlit night along an endless
column of retreating soldiers, who were laughing,
smoking, and chatting as though not in
the least depressed by their withdrawal from
the dry and cosy trenches of Nivelle which
they were abandoning.</p>

"LA BRABAN&Ccedil;ONNE"</head>

<p>No shells were falling in Nivelle as they
left the car on the outskirts of the town and
entered the long main street. That was all
of Nivelle, a long, treeless main street from
which branched a few alleys.</p>

<p>Smouldering d&eacute;bris of what had been houses
illuminated the street. There were no other
lights. Nothing stirred except a gaunt cat
flitting like a shadow along the gutter. There
was not a sound save the faint stirring of
the cinders over which pale flames played
fitfully.</p>

<p>Abandoned trenches ditched the little town
in every direction; temporary shelters made
of boughs, sheds, and broken-down wagons
stood along the street. Otherwise, all impedimenta,
materials, and stores had appar<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>ently
been removed by the retreating columns.
There was little wreckage except the burning
d&eacute;bris of the few shell-struck houses&mdash;a few
rags, a few piles of firewood, a bundle of
straw and hay here and there.</p>

<p>High, mounting toward the stars, the ancient
tower with its gilded hippogriff dominated
the place&mdash;a vast, vague shape brooding
over the single mile-long street and grimy
alleys branching from it.</p>

<p>Nobody guarded the portal; the ancient
doors stood wide open; pitch darkness reigned
within.</p>

<p>"Do you know the way?" whispered the
airman.</p>

<p>"Yes. Take hold of my hand."</p>

<p>He dared not use his flash. Carrying bundle
and bombsack under one arm, he sought
for her hand and encountered it. Cool, slim
fingers closed over his.</p>

<p>After a few moments' stealthy advance, she
whispered:</p>

<p>"Here are the stairs. Be careful; they
twist."</p>

<p>She started upward, feeling with her feet<pb n='241'/><anchor id='Pg241'/>

for every stone step. The ascent appeared
to be interminable; the narrowing stone spiral
seemed to have no end. Her hand grew warm
within his own.</p>

<p>But at last they felt a fresh wind blowing
and caught a glimpse of stars above them.</p>

<p>Then, tier on tier, the bells of the carillon,
fixed to their great beams, appeared above
them&mdash;a shadowy, bewildering wilderness of
bells, rising, rank above rank, until they vanished
in the darkness overhead. Beside them,
almost touching them, loomed the great bell
Clovis, a gigantic mass bulking enormously
in that shadowy place.</p>

<p>A sonorous wind flowed through the open
tower, eddying among the bells&mdash;a strong,
keen night wind blowing from the north.</p>

<p>The airman walked to the south parapet
and looked down. Below him in the starlight,
like an indistinct map spread out, lay the
Nivelle redoubt and the trench with its
gabions, its sand bags, its timbers, its dugouts.</p>

<p>Very far away to the southeast they could
see the glare of rockets and exploding shells,
but the sound of the bombardment did not<pb n='242'/><anchor id='Pg242'/>
reach them. North, a single searchlight
played and switched across the clouds; west,
all was dark.</p>

<p>"They'll arrive just before dawn," said the
airman, placing his sack of bombs on the
pavement under the parapet. "Come, little
bell-mistress, take me to see your keyboard."</p>

<p>"It is below&mdash;a few steps. This way&mdash;if
you will follow me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned to the stone stairs again, descended
a dozen steps, opened a door on a
narrow landing.</p>

<p>And there, in the starlight, he saw the keyboard
and the bewildering maze of wires running
up and branching like a huge web toward
the tiers of bells above.</p>

<p>He looked at the keyboard curiously. The
little mistress of the bells displayed the two
wooden gloves with which she encased her
hands when she played the carillon.</p>

<p>"It would be impossible for one to play
unless one's hands are armoured," she explained.</p>

<p>"It is almost a lost art," he mused aloud,
"&mdash;this playing the carillon&mdash;this wonderful<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>
bell-music of the middle ages. There are few
great bell-masters in this day."</p>

<p>"Few," she said dreamily.</p>

<p>"And"&mdash;he turned and stared at her&mdash;"few
mistresses of the bells, I imagine."</p>

<p>"I think I am the only one in France or in
Flanders.... And there are few carillons
left. The Huns are battering them down.
Towers of the ancient ages are falling everywhere
in Flanders and in France under their
shell fire. Very soon there will be no more
of the old carillons left; no more bell-music
in the world." She sighed heavily. "It is a
pity."</p>

<p>She seated herself at the keyboard.</p>

<p>"Dare I play?" she asked, looking up over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"No; it would only mean a shell from the
Huns."</p>

<p>She nodded, laid the wooden gloves beside
her and let her delicate hands wander over
the mute keys.</p>

<p>Leaning beside her the airman quietly explained
the plan they were to follow.</p>

<p>"With dawn they will come creeping into<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>
Nivelle&mdash;the Huns," he said. "I have one of
their officers' uniforms in that bundle above.
I shall try to pass as a general officer. You
see, I speak German. My education was
partly ruined in Germany. So I'll get on very
well, I expect.</p>

<p>"And directly under us is the trench and
the main redoubt. They'll occupy that first
thing. They'll swarm there&mdash;the whole trench
will be crawling with them. They'll install
their gas cylinders at once, this wind being
their wind.</p>

<p>"But with sunrise the wind changes&mdash;and
whether it changes or not, I don't care," he
added. "I've got them at last where I want
them."</p>

<p>The girl looked up at him. He smiled that
terrifying smile of his:</p>

<p>"With the explosion of my first bomb among
their gas cylinders you are to start these bells
above us. Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You are to play 'La Braban&ccedil;onne.' That
is the signal to our trenches."</p>

<p>"I have often played it," she said coolly.<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/></p>

<p>"Not in the teeth of a barbarian army. Not
in the faces of a murderous soldiery."</p>

<p>The girl sat quite still for a few moments;
then looking up at him, and very pale in the
starlight:</p>

<p>"Do you think they will tear me to pieces,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>"I mean to hold those stairs with my sack
of bombs until our people enter the trenches.
If they can do it in an hour we will be all
right."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is only a half-hour affair from our
salient. I allow our people an hour."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But if, even now, you had rather go
back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>No!</hi>"</p>

<p>"There is no disgrace in going back."</p>

<p>"You said once, 'anybody can weep for
friend and country. Few avenge either.' I
am&mdash;happy&mdash;to be among the few."</p>

<p>He nodded. After a moment he said:</p>

<p>"I'll bet you something. My country is all<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>
right, but it's sick. It's<lb/> got a nauseous dose
of verbiage to spew up&mdash;something it's swallowed&mdash;something
about being too proud to
fight.... My brother and I couldn't stand
it, so we came to France.... He was in the
photo air service. He was in mufti&mdash;and
about two miles up, I believe. Six Huns went
for him.... And winged him. He had to
land behind their lines.... In mufti....
Well&mdash;I've never found courage to hear the
details. I can't stand them&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Your brother&mdash;is dead, monsieur?" she
asked timidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. With&mdash;circumstances. Well, then&mdash;after
that, from an ordinary, commonplace
man I became a machine for the extermination
of vermin. That's all I am&mdash;an animated magazine
of Persian powder&mdash;or I do it in any
handy way. It's not a sporting proposition,
you see, just get rid of them any old way.
You don't understand, do you?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;little."</p>

<p>"But it's slow work&mdash;slow work," he muttered
vaguely, "&mdash;and the world is crawling&mdash;crawling
with them. But if God guides my<pb n='247'/><anchor id='Pg247'/>

bomb this time and if I hit one of their gas
cylinders&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>that</hi> ought to be worth while."</p>

<p>In the starlight his features became tense
and terrible; she shivered in her threadbare
jacket.</p>

<p>After a few moments' silence he went away
up the steps to put on his German uniform.
When he descended again she had a troubled
question for him to answer:</p>

<p>"But how shall you account for me, a French
girl, monsieur, if they come to the belfry?"</p>

<p>A heavy flush darkened his face:</p>

<p>"Little mistress of the bells, I shall pretend
to be what the Huns are. Do you know how
they treat French women?"</p>

<p>"I have heard," she said faintly.</p>

<p>"Then if they come and find you here as
my&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>prisoner</hi>&mdash;they will think they understand."</p>

<p>The colour flamed in her face and she bowed
it, resting her elbows on the keyboard.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "don't be distressed. Does
it matter what a Hun thinks? Come; let's
be cheerful. Can you hum for me 'La Braban&ccedil;onne'?"<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/></p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," he said. "But it's a
grand battle anthem.... We Americans have
one.... It's out of fashion. And after all,
I had rather hear 'La Braban&ccedil;onne' when the
time comes.... What a terrible admission!
But what Americans have done to my country
is far more terrible. The nation's sick&mdash;sick!...
I prefer 'La Braban&ccedil;onne' for the time
being."</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>The Prussians entered Nivelle a little before
dawn. The airman had been watching
the street below. Down there in the slight
glow from the cinders of what once had been
a cottage a cat had been squatting, staring
at the bed of coals, as though she were once
more installed upon the family hearthstone.</p>

<p>Then something unseen as yet by the airman
attracted the animal's attention. Alert,
crouching, she stared down the vista of dark,
deserted houses, then turned and fled like a
ghost.</p>

<p>For a long while the airman perceived
nothing. Suddenly close to the house fa&ccedil;ades<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>

on either side of the street, shadowy forms
came gliding forward.</p>

<p>They passed the glowing embers and went
on toward Sainte-Lesse; j&auml;gers, with knapsacks
on back and rifles trailing; and on their
heads oddly shaped pot helmets with battered
looking visors.</p>

<p>One or two motorcyclists followed, whizzing
through the desolate street and into the
country beyond.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, out of the throat of
the darkness emerged a solid column of infantry.
In a moment, beneath the bell tower, the
ground was swarming with Huns; every inch
of the earth became infested with them; fields,
hedges, alleys crawled alive with Germans.
They overran every road, every street, every
inch of open country; their wagons choked the
main thoroughfare, they were already establishing
themselves in the redoubt below, in the
trench, running in and out of dugouts and all
over scarp, counter-scarp, parades and parapet,
ant-like in energy, busy with machine gun,
trench mortar, installing telephones, searchlights,
periscopes, machine guns.<pb n='250'/><anchor id='Pg250'/></p>

<p>Automobiles arrived&mdash;two armoured cars
and grey passenger machines in which there
were officers.</p>

<p>The airman laid his hand on Maryette's arm.</p>

<p>"Little bell-mistress," he said, "German officers
are coming into the tower. I want them
to find you in my arms when they come up
into this belfry. Understand me, and forgive
me."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;understand," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Play your part bravely. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He put his arms around her; they stood
rigid, listening.</p>

<p>"Now!" he whispered, and drew her close,
kissing her.</p>

<p>Spurred boots clattered on the stone floor:</p>

<p>"Herr Je!" exclaimed an astonished voice.
Somebody laughed. But the airman coolly
pushed the girl aside, and as the faint grey
light of dawn fell on his field uniform bearing
the ribbon of the iron cross, two pairs of
spurred heels hastily clinked together and two
hands flew to the oddly shaped helmet visors.</p>

<p>"Also!" exclaimed the airman in a mincing<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>
Berlin accent. "When I require a corps of
observers I usually send my aide. That being
now quite perfectly understood, you gentlemen
will give yourselves the trouble to descend
as you have come. Further, you will place a
sentry at the tower door, and inform enquirers
that General Count von Gierdorff and his
staff are occupying the Nivelle belfry for purposes
of observation."</p>

<p>The astounded officers saluted steadily; and
if they imagined that the mythical staff of this
general officer was clustered aloft somewhere
up there where the bells hung it was impossible
to tell by the strained expressions on their
wooden countenances.</p>

<p>However, it was evidently perfectly plain
to them what the high Excellenz was about in
this vaulted room where wires led aloft to
an unseen carillon on the landing in the belfry
above.</p>

<p>The airman nodded; they went. And when
their clattering steps echoed far below on the
spiral stone stairs, the airman motioned to
the little bell-mistress. She followed him up
the short flight to where the bells hung.<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/></p>

<p>"We're in for it now," he said. "If High
Command comes into this place to investigate
then I shall have to hold those stairs....
It's growing quite light in the east. Which
way is the wind?"</p>

<p>"North," she said in a steady voice. She
was terribly pale.</p>

<p>He went to the parapet and looked over,
half wondering, perhaps, whether he would
receive a rifle shot through the head.</p>

<p>Far below at the foot of the bell-tower
the dimly discerned Nivelle redoubt, swarming
with men, was being armed; and, to the south,
wired he thought, but could not see distinctly.</p>

<p>Then, as the dusk of early dawn grew
greyer, the first rifle shots rattled out in
the west. The French salient was saluting
the wire-stringers.</p>

<p>Back under shelter they tumbled; whistles
sounded distantly; a trench mortar crashed;
then the accentless tattoo of machine guns
broke from every emplacement.</p>

<p>"The east is turning a little yellow," he said
calmly. "I believe this matter is going through.<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
Toss some dust into the air. Which way?"</p>

<p>"North," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Good. I think they're placing their cylinders.
I think I can see them laying their coils.
I'm certain of it. What luck!"</p>

<p>The airman was becoming excited and his
voice trembled a little with the effort to control
it.</p>

<p>"It's growing pink in the east. Try a handful
of dust again," he suggested almost gaily.</p>

<p>"North," she said briefly, watching the dust
aloft.</p>

<p>"Luck's with us! Look at the east! If
their High Command keeps his nose out of
this place!&mdash;if he <hi rend='italic'>does</hi>!&mdash;Look at the east, little
bell-mistress! It's all gold! There's pink
up higher. I can see a faint tinge of blue,
too. Can you?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>A minute dragged like a year in prison.
Then:</p>

<p>"Try the wind again," he said in a strained
voice.</p>

<p>"North."</p>

<p>"Oh, luck! Luck!" he muttered, slinging his<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>
sack of bombs over his shoulder. "We've
got them! We've certainly got them! What's
that! An airplane! Look, little girl&mdash;one of
our planes is up. There's another! Which
way is the wind?"</p>

<p>"North."</p>

<p>"Got 'em!" he snapped between his teeth.
"Run over to the stairs. Listen! Is anybody
coming up?"</p>

<p>"I can hear nothing."</p>

<p>"Stand there and listen. Never mind the
row the guns are making; listen for somebody
on the stairs. Look how light it's getting!
The sun will push up before many
minutes. We've got 'em! <hi rend='italic'>Got 'em!</hi> Wet
your finger and try the wind!"</p>

<p>"North."</p>

<p>"North here, too. What do you know about
that! Luck! Luck's with us! And we've got
'em&mdash;!" he lifted his clenched hand and
laughed at her. "Like that!" he said, his blue
eyes blazing. "They're getting ready to gas
below. Look at 'em! Glory to God! I can
see two cylinders directly under me. They're
manning the nozzles! Every man is masking<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>
at his post! Anybody on the stairs! Any
sound?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Are you certain?"</p>

<p>"It is as still as death below."</p>

<p>"Try the dust. The wind's changing, I
think. Quick! Which way?"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>West.</hi>"</p>

<p>"Oh, glory! Glory to God! They feel it
below! They know. The wind has changed.
Off came their respirators. No gas this morning,
eh? Yes, by God, there will be gas enough
for all&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He caught up a bomb, leaned over the parapet,
held it aloft, poised, aiming steadily for
one second of concentrated co&ouml;rdination of
mind and muscle. Then straight down he
launched it. The cylinder beneath him was
shattered and a green geyser of gas burst from
it deluging the trench.</p>

<p>Already a second bomb followed the first,
then another, and then a third; and with the
last report another cylinder in the trench below
burst into thick green billows of death and
flowed over the ground, <hi rend='italic'>west</hi>.<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/></p>

<p>Two more bombs whirled down, bursting on
a machine gun; then the airman turned with a
cry of triumph, and at the same instant the
sun rose above the hills and flung a golden
ray straight across his face.</p>

<p>To Maryette the man stood transfigured,
like the Blazing Guardian of the Flaming
Sword.</p>

<p>"Ring out your Braban&ccedil;onne!" he cried.
"Let the Huns hear the war song of the land
they've trampled! Now! Little bell-mistress,
arm your white hands with your wooden gloves
and make this old carillon speak in brass and
iron!"</p>

<p>He caught her by the arm; they ran down
the short flight of steps; she drew on her
wooden gloves and sprang to the keyboard.</p>

<p>"I'll hold the stairs!" he cried. "I can
hold these stairs for an hour against the
whole world in arms. Now, then! The Braban&ccedil;onne!"</p>

<p>Above the roaring confusion and the explosions
far below, from high up in the sky a
clear bell note floated as though out of
Heaven itself&mdash;another, others, crystalline<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
clear, imperious, filling all the sky with their
amazing and terrible beauty.</p>

<p>The mistress of the bells struck the keyboard
with armoured hands&mdash;beautiful, slender,
avenging hands; the bells above her
crashed out into the battle-song of Flanders,
filling sky and earth with its splendid defiance
of the Hun.</p>

<p>The airman, bomb in hand, stood at the
head of the stone stairs; the ancient tower
rocked with the fiercely magnificent anthem
of revolt&mdash;the war cry of a devastated land&mdash;the
land that died to save the world&mdash;the
martyr, Belgium, still prone in the deathly
trance awaiting her certain resurrection.</p>

<p>The rising sun struck the tower where
three score ancient bells poured from metal
throats their heavenly summons to battle!</p>

<p>The Hun heard it, tumbling, clawing, strangling
below in the hellish vapours of his own
death-fog; and now, from the rear his sky-guns
hurled shrapnel at the carillon in the
belfry of Nivelle.</p>

<p>Clouds possessed the tower&mdash;soft, white,
fleecy clouds rolling, unfolding, floating about<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>
the ancient buttresses and gargoyles. An iron
hail rained on slate and parapet and resounding
bell-metal. But the bells pealed and pealed
in clear-voiced beauty, and Clovis, the great
iron giant, hung, scarcely sonorous under the
shrapnel rain.</p>

<p>Suddenly there were bayonets on the stairs&mdash;the
clatter of heavy feet&mdash;alien faces on the
threshold. Then a bomb flew, and the terrible
crash cleared the stairs.</p>

<p>Twice more the clatter came with the clank
of bayonets and guttural cries; but both died
out in the infernal roar of the grenades exploding
inside that stony spiral. And no more
bayonets flickered on the stairs.</p>

<p>The airman, frozen to a statue, listened.
Again and again he thought he could hear
bugles, but the roar from below blotted out
the distant call.</p>

<p>"Little bell-mistress!"</p>

<p>She turned her head, her hands still striking
the keyboard. He spoke through the confusion
of the place:</p>

<p>"Sound the tocsin!"</p>

<p>Then Clovis thundered from the belfry like<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>

a great gun fired, booming out over the world.
Around the iron colossus shrapnel swept in
gusts; Clovis thundered on, annihilating all
sound except his own tremendous voice, heedless
of shell and bullet, disdainful of the hell's
shambles below, where masked French infantry
were already leaping the parapets of Nivelle
Redoubt into the squirming masses below.</p>

<p>The airman shouted at her through the
tumult:</p>

<p>"They murdered my brother. Did I tell
you? They hacked him to slivers with their
bayonets. I've settled the reckoning down in
the gas there&mdash;their own green gas, damn
them! You don't understand what I say, do
you? He was my brother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A frightful explosion blew in the oubliette;
the room rattled and clattered with shrapnel.</p>

<p>The airman swayed where he stood in the
swirling smoke, lurched up against the stone
coping, slid down to his knees.</p>

<p>When his eyes opened the little bell-mistress
was bending over him.</p>

<p>"They got me," he gasped. All the front of
his tunic was sopping red.<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/></p>

<p>"They said it meant the cross&mdash;if I made
good.... Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she whispered. "But you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on and play!" he whispered with a terrible
effort.</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Braban&ccedil;onne! Quick!"</p>

<p>She went, whimpering. Standing before the
keyboard she pulled on her wooden gloves and
struck the keys.</p>

<p>Out over the infernal uproar below pealed
the bells; the morning sky rang with the noble
summons to all brave men. Once more the
ancient tower trembled with the mighty out-crash
of the battle hymn.</p>

<p>With the last note she turned and looked
down at him where he lay against the wall. He
opened his glazing eyes and tried to smile at
her.</p>

<p>"Bully," he whispered. "Could you recite&mdash;the
words&mdash;to me&mdash;just so I could hear them
on my way&mdash;West?"</p>

<p>She left the keyboard, came and dropped
on her knees beside him; and closing her eyes
to check the tears sang in a low, tremulous,<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>
girlish voice, De Lonlay's words, to the battle
anthem of revolution.</p>

<p>"Bully," he sighed. And spoke no more on
earth.</p>

<p>But the little mistress of the bells did not
know his soul had passed.</p>

<p>And the French officer who came leaping up
the stairs, pistol lifted, halted in astonishment
to see a dead man lying beside a sack of
bombs and a young girl on her knees beside
him, weeping and tremblingly intoning "La
Braban&ccedil;onne."</p>

THE GARDENER</head>

<p>A week later, toward noon, as usual, the
two American, muleteers, Smith and Glenn,
sauntered over from their corral to the White
Doe Tavern where, it being a meatless day,
they ate largely of potato soup and of a
tench, smoking hot.</p>

<p>The tench had been caught that morning off
the back doorstep, which was an ancient and
mossy slab of limestone let into the coping of
the river wall.</p>

<p>Jean Courtray, the crippled inn-keeper,
caught it. All that morning he had sat there
in the sun on the river wall, half dozing, opening
his dim eyes at intervals to gaze at his
painted quill afloat among the water weeds of
the little river Lesse. At intervals, too, he
turned his head with that peculiar movement<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>
of the old, and peered at his daughter, Maryette,
and the Belgian gardener who were working
among the potatoes in the garden.</p>

<p>And at last he had hooked his fish and the
emaciated young Belgian dropped his hoe and
came over and released it from the hook where
it lay flopping and quivering and glittering
among the wild grasses on the river bank. And
that was how Kid Glenn and Sticky Smith,
American muleteers on duty at Saint Lesse,
came to lunch on freshly caught tench at the
Inn of the White Doe.</p>

<p>After luncheon, agreeably satiated, they rose
from the table in the little dining room and
strolled out to the garden in the rear of the
inn, their Mexican spurs clanking. Maryette
heard them; they tipped their caps to her;
she acknowledged their salute gravely and continued
to cultivate her garden with a hoe, the
blond, consumptive Belgian trundling a rickety
cultivator at her heels.</p>

<p>"Look, Stick," drawled Glenn. "Maryette's
got her decoration on."</p>

<p>From where they lounged by the river wall<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>
they could see the cross of the Legion pinned
to the girl's blouse.</p>

<p>Both muleteers had been present at the investment
the day before, when a general officer
arrived from Paris and the entire garrison of
Sainte Lesse had been paraded&mdash;an impressive
total of three dozen men&mdash;six gendarmes and
a brigadier; one remount sub-lieutenant and
twenty troopers; a veterinary, two white American
muleteers, and five American negro hostlers
from Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>The girl had nearly died of shyness during
the ceremony, had endured the accolade with
crimson cheeks, had stammered a whispered
response to the congratulations of neighbors
who had gathered to see the little bell-mistress
of Sainte Lesse honoured by the country which
she had served in the belfry of Nivelle.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>As she came past Smith and Glenn, trailing
her hoe, the latter now sufficiently proficient
in French, said gaily:</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Jack again, Mamzelle Maryette?"</p>

<p>The girl blushed:<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/></p>

<p>"I hear from Djack by every mail," she
said, with all the transparent honesty that
characterized her.</p>

<p>Smith grinned:</p>

<p>"Just like that! Well, tell him from me
to quit fooling away his time in a hospital
and come and get you or somebody is going
to steal you."</p>

<p>The girl was very happy; she stood there
in the September sunshine leaning on her hoe
and gazing half shyly, half humorously down
the river where a string of American mules
was being watered.</p>

<p>Mellow Ethiopian laughter sounded from the
distance as the Baton Rouge negroes exchanged
pleasantries in limited French with
a couple of gendarmes on the bank above them.
And there, in the sunshine of the little garden
by the river, war and death seemed very far
away. Only at intervals the veering breeze
brought to Sainte Lesse the immense vibration
of the cannonade; only at intervals the
high sky-clatter of an airplane reminded the
village that the front was only a little north<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>
of Nivelle, and that what had been Nivelle
was not so very far away.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>"If you were <hi rend='italic'>my</hi> girl, Maryette," remarked
Smith, "I'd die of worry in that hospital."</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>You</hi> might have reason to, Monsieur," retorted
the girl demurely. "But you see it's
Djack who is convalescing, not you."</p>

<p>She had become accustomed to the ceaseless
banter of Burley's two comrades&mdash;a banter
entirely American, and which at first she was
unable to understand. But now all things
American, including accent and odd, perverted
humour, had become very dear to her. The
clink-clank of the muleteer's big spurs always
set her heart beating; the sight of an arriving
convoy from the Channel port thrilled her,
and to her the trample of mules, the shouts
of foreign negroes, the drawling, broken French
spoken by the white muleteers made heavenly
real to her the dream which love had so suddenly
invaded, and into which, as suddenly,
strode Death, clutching at Love.</p>

<p>She had beaten him off&mdash;she had&mdash;or God
had&mdash;routed Death, driven him from the dream.<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>
For it was a dream to her still, and she thought
she could never be able to comprehend the
magic reality of it, even when at last her
man, "Djack," came back to prove the blessed
miracle which held her in the magic of its
thrall.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>"Who's the guy with the wheelbarrow?" inquired
Sticky Smith, rolling a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Karl, his name is," she answered; "&mdash;a
Belgian refugee."</p>

<p>"He looks like a Hun to me," remarked
Glenn, bluntly.</p>

<p>"He has his papers," said the girl.</p>

<p>Glenn shrugged.</p>

<p>"With his little pink eyes of a pig and his
whitish hair and eyebrows&mdash;well, maybe they
make 'em like that in Belgium."</p>

<p>"Papers," added Smith, "<hi rend='italic'>can</hi> be swiped."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head:</p>

<p>"He's an invalid student from Ypres. He
looks quite ill, I think."</p>

<p>"He looks the lunger, all right. But Huns
have it, too. What does he do&mdash;wander about
town at will?"<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/></p>

<p>"He works for us, monsieur. Your suspicions
are harsh. Karl is quite harmless, poor
boy."</p>

<p>"What does he do after hours?" demanded
Sticky Smith, watching the man&oelig;uvres of the
sickly blond youth and the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Smith, if you knew how innocent
is his pastime!" she exclaimed, laughing. "He
collects and studies moths and butterflies. Is
there, if you please, a mania more harmless in
the world?... And now I must return to my
work, messieurs."</p>

<p>As the two muleteers strode clanking away
toward the canal in the meadow, the blond
youth turned his head and looked after them
out of eyes which were naturally pale and
small, and which, as he watched the two Americans,
seemed to grow paler and smaller yet.</p>

<p>That afternoon old Courtray, swathed in a
shawl, sat on the mossy doorstep and fished
among the water weeds of the river. The sun
was low; work in the garden had ended.</p>

<p>Maryette had gone up into her belfry to
play the sunset hymn on the noble old carillon.
Through the sunset sky the lovely bell-notes<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
floated far and wide, exquisitely chaste and
aloof as the high-showering ecstasy of a skylark.</p>

<p>As always the little village looked upward
and listened, pausing in its humble duties as
long as their little bell-mistress remained in
her tower.</p>

<p>After the hymn she played "Myn hart is vol
verlangen" and "Het Lied der Vlamingen,"
and ended with the delicate, bewitching little
folk-song, "Myn Vryer," by Hasselt.</p>

<p>Then in the red glow of the setting sun the
girl laid aside her wooden gloves, rose from
the ancient keyboard, wound up the drum, and,
her duty done for the evening, came down out
of the tower among the transparent evening
shadows of the tree-lined village street.</p>

<p>The sun hung over Nivelle hills, which had
turned to amethyst. Sunbeams laced the little
river in a red net through which old Courtray's
quill stemmed the ripples. He still
clutched his fishing pole, but his eyes were
closed, his chin resting on his chest.</p>

<p>Maryette came silently into the garden and
looked at her father&mdash;looked at the blond Karl<pb n='270'/><anchor id='Pg270'/>
seated on the river wall beside the dozing
angler. The blond youth had a box on his
knees into which he was intently peering.</p>

<p>The girl came to the river wall and seated
herself at her father's feet. The Belgian refugee
student had already risen to attention, his
heels together, but Maryette signed him to be
seated again.</p>

<p>"What have you found now, Karl?" she inquired
in a cautiously modulated voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle, fancy! I haff by chance
with my cultivator among your potatoes already
twenty pup&aelig; of the magnificent moth, Sphinx
Atropos, upturned! See! Regard them, mademoiselle!
What lucky chance! What fortune
for me, an entomologist, this wonderful sphinx
moth to discover encased within its chrysalis!"</p>

<p>The girl smiled at his enthusiasm:</p>

<p>"But, Karl, those funny, smooth brown
things which resemble little polished evergreen-cones
are not rare in my garden. Often, when
spading or hoeing among the potato vines, I
uncover them."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, the caterpillar which makes
this chrysalis feeds by night on the leaves of<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>

the potato, and, when ready to transform, burrows
into the earth to become a <corr sic='chryalis'>chrysalis</corr> or
pupa, as we call it. That iss why mademoiselle
has often disinterred the pup&aelig; of this largest
and strangest of our native sphinx-moths."</p>

<p>Maryette leaned over and looked into the
wooden box, where lay the chrysalides.</p>

<p>"What kind of moth do they make?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He blinked his small, pale eyes:</p>

<p>"The Death's Head," he said, complacently.</p>

<p>The girl recoiled involuntarily:</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed under her breath,
"&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>that</hi> creature!"</p>

<p>For everywhere in France the great moth,
with its strange and ominous markings, is perfectly
well known. To the superstitious it is
a creature of evil omen in its fulvous, black
and lead-coloured livery of death. For the
broad, furry thorax bears a skull, and the big,
mousy body the yellow ribs of a skeleton.</p>

<p>Measuring often more than five inches across
the expanded wings, its formidable size alone
might be sufficient to inspire alarm, but in addition
it possesses a horrid attribute unknown<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>

among other moths and butterflies; it can
utter a cry&mdash;a tiny shrill, shuddering complaint.
Small wonder, perhaps, that the peasant
holds it in horror&mdash;this sleek, furry, powerfully
winged creature marked with skull and
bones, which whirrs through the night and
comes thudding against the window, and
shrieks horridly when touched by a human
hand.</p>

<p>"So <hi rend='italic'>that</hi> is what turns into the Death's Head
moth," said the girl in a low voice as though
to herself. "I never knew it. I thought those
things were legless cock-chafers when I dug
them out of potato hills. Karl, why do you
keep them?"</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle! To study them. To
breed from them the moth. The Death's Head
is magnificent."</p>

<p>"God made it," admitted the girl with a
faint shudder, "but I am afraid I could not
love it. When do they hatch out?"</p>

<p>"It is time now. It is not like others of the
sphinx family. Incubation requires but a few
weeks. These are nearly ready to emerge,
mademoiselle."<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/></p>

<p>"Oh. And then what do they do?"</p>

<p>"They mate."</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"The males seek the females," he said in his
pedantic, monotonous voice. "And so ardent
are the lovers that although there be no female
moth within five, eight, perhaps ten miles, yet
will her lover surely search through the night
for her and find her."</p>

<p>Maryette shuddered again in spite of herself.
The thought of this creature marked
with the emblems of death and possessed of
ardour, too, was distasteful.</p>

<p>"Amour macabre&mdash;what an unpleasant
thought, Karl. I do not care for your Death's
Head and for the history of their amours."</p>

<p>She turned and gently laid her head on her
father's knees. The young man regarded her
with a pallid sneer.</p>

<p>Addressing her back, still holding his boxful
of pup&aelig; on his bony knees, he said with
the sneer quite audible in his voice:</p>

<p>"Your famous savant, Fabre, first inspired
me to study the sex habits of the Death's
Head."<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/></p>

<p>She made no reply, her cheek resting on her
father's knees.</p>

<p>"It was because of his wonderful experiments
with the Great Peacock moth and with
others of the genus that I have studied to
acquaint myself concerning the amours of the
Death's Head. <hi rend='italic'>And I have discovered that he
will find the female even if she be miles and
miles away.</hi>"</p>

<p>The man was grinning now in the dusk&mdash;grinning
like a skull; but the girl's back was
still turned and she merely found something
in his voice not quite agreeable.</p>

<p>"I think," she said in a low, quiet voice,
"that I have now heard sufficient about the
Death's Head moth."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;have I offended mademoiselle? I ask
a thousand pardons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Old Courtray awoke in the dusk.</p>

<p>"My quill, Maryette," he muttered, "&mdash;see if
it floats yet?"</p>

<p>The girl bent over the water and strained
her eyes. Her father tested the line with shaky
hands. There was no fish on the hook.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Voyons!</hi> The <hi rend='italic'>asticot</hi> also is gone. Some<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>

robber fish has been nibbling!" exclaimed the
girl cheerfully, reeling in the line. "Father,
one cannot fish and doze at the same time."</p>

<p>"Eternal vigilance is the price of success&mdash;in
peace as well as in war," said Karl, the student,
as he aided Maryette to raise her father
from the chair.</p>

<p>"Vigilance," repeated the girl. "Yes, always
now in France. Because always the
enemy is listening." ... Her strong young
arm around her father, she traversed the garden
slowly toward the house. A pleasant
odour came from the kitchen of the White Doe,
where an old peasant woman was cooking.</p>

THE SUSPECT</head>

<p>That night she wrote to her lover at the
great hospital in the south, where he lay slowly
growing well:</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p><hi rend='smallcaps'>My Djack:</hi></p>

<p>Today has been very beautiful, made so for me by my thoughts of you
and by a warm September sun which makes for human happiness, too.</p>

<p>I am wearing my ribbon of the Legion. Ah, my Djack, it belongs more
rightly to you, who would not let me go alone to Nivelle that
dreadful day. Why do they not give you the cross? They must be very
stupid in Paris.</p>

<p>All day my happy thoughts have been with you, my Djack. It all seems
a blessed dream that we love each other. And I&mdash;oh, how could I have
been so ignorant, so silly, not to know it sooner than I did!</p>

<p>I don't know; I thought it was friendship. And that was so wonderful
to me that I never dreamed any other miracle possible!</p>

<p><hi rend='italic'>Allons</hi>, my Djack. Come and instruct me quickly, <pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>because my desire
for further knowledge is very ardent.</p>

<p>The news? <hi rend='italic'>Cher ami</hi>, there is little. Always the far thunder beyond
Nivelle in ruins; sometimes a battle-plane high in the blue; a
convoy of your beloved mules arriving from the coast; nothing more
exciting.</p>

<p>Monsieur Smeet and Monsieur Glenn inquire always concerning you.
They are brave and kind; their odd jests amuse me.</p>

<p>My father caught a tench in the Lesse this morning.</p>

<p>My gardener, Karl, collected many unpleasant creatures while hoeing
our potatoes. Poor lad, he seems unhealthy. I am glad I could offer
him employment.</p>

<p>My Djack, there could not possibly be any mistake about him, could
there? His papers are en r&egrave;gle. He is what he pretends, a Belgian
student from Ypres in distress and ill health, is he not?</p>

<p>But how can you answer me, you who lie there all alone in a hospital
at Nice? Also, I am ashamed of myself for doubting the unfortunate
young man. I am too happy to doubt anybody, perhaps.</p>

<p>And so good night, my Djack. Sleep sweetly, guarded by powerful
angels.</p>

</quote>
  
<p>She had been writing in the deserted caf&eacute;.
Now she took a candle and went slowly up<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>stairs.
On the white plaster wall of her bedroom
was a Death's Head moth.</p>

<p>The girl, startled for an instant, stood still;
an unfeigned shiver of displeasure passed over
her. Not that the Death's Head was an unfamiliar
or terrifying sight to her; in late
summer she usually saw one or two which had
flown through some lighted window.</p>

<p>But it was the amorous history of this creature
which the student Karl had related that
now repelled her. This night creature with
the skull on its neck, once scarcely noticed, had
now become a trifle repulsive.</p>

<p>She went nearer, lifting the lighted candle.
The thing crouched there with slanted wings.
It was newly hatched, its sleek body still wet
with the humors of incubation&mdash;wet as a
soaked mouse. Its abdomen, too, seemed enormous,
all swelled and distended with unfertilized
eggs. No, there could be no question concerning
the sex of the thing; this was a female,
and her tumefied body was almost bursting
with eggs.</p>

<p>In startling design the yellow skull stood
out; the ribs of the skeleton. Two tiny, fiery<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
eyes glimmered at the base of the antenn&aelig;&mdash;two
minute jewelled sparks of glowing, lambent
fire. They seemed to be watching her, maliciously
askance.</p>

<p>The very horrid part of it was that, if
touched, the creature would cry out. The girl
knew this, hesitated, looked at the open window
through which it must have crawled, and sat
down on her bed to consider the situation.</p>

<p>"After all," she said to herself resolutely.
"God made it. It is harmless. If God thought
fit to paint one of his lesser creatures like a
skeleton, perhaps it was to remind us that
life is brief and that we should lose no time
to live it nobly in His sight.... I think that
perhaps explains it."</p>

<p>However, she did not undress.</p>

<p>"I am quite foolish to be afraid of this
poor moth. I repeat that I am foolish. <hi rend='italic'>Allez</hi>&mdash;I
am <hi rend='italic'>not</hi> afraid. I am no longer afraid. I&mdash;I
admire this handiwork of God."</p>

<p>She sat looking at the creature, her hands
lying clasped in her lap.</p>

<p>"It's a very odd thing," she said to herself,
"that a lover can find this creature even if he<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>

be miles and miles away.... Maybe he's on
his way now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instinctively she sprang up and closed her
bedroom window.</p>

<p>"No," she said, looking severely at the
motionless moth, "you shall have no visitors in
my room. You may remain here; I shall not
disturb you; and tomorrow you will go away
of your own accord. But I cannot permit you
to receive company&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A heavy fall on the floor above checked her.
Breathless, listening, she crept to her door.</p>

<p>"Karl!" she called.</p>

<p>Listening again, she could hear distant and
vaguely dreadful sounds from the gardener-student's
room above.</p>

<p>She was frightened but she went up. The
youth had had a bad hemorrhage. She sat
beside him late into the night. After his
breathing grew quieter, sitting there in silence
she could hear odd sounds, rustling, squeaking
sounds from the box of Death's Head chrysalids
on the night table beside his bed.</p>

<p>The pup&aelig; of the Death's Head were making
merry in anticipation of the rapidly approach<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>ing
change&mdash;the Great Adventure of their lives&mdash;the
coming metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The youth lay asleep now. As she
extinguished the candle and stole from the room, all
the pup&aelig; of the Death's Head began to squeak
in the darkness.</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>The student-gardener could do no more
work for the present. He lay propped up in
bed, pasty, scarlet lipped, and he seemed bald
and lidless, so colourless were hair and eye-lashes.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you, Karl?" asked
Maryette, coming in for a moment as usual in
the intervals of her many duties.</p>

<p>"The ink, if you would be so condescending&mdash;and
a pen," he said, watching her out of
hollow, sallow eyes of watery blue.</p>

<p>She fetched both from the caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>She came again in another hour, knocking
at his door, but he said rather sharply that
he wished to sleep.</p>

<p>Scarcely noticing the querulous tone, she
departed. She had much to do besides her
duties in the belfry. Her father was an invalid<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>
who required constant care; there was only
one servant, an old peasant woman who cooked.
The Government required her father to keep
open the White Doe Tavern, and there was
always a little business from the scanty
garrison of Sainte Lesse, always a few meals to get,
a few drinks to serve, and nobody now to do
it except herself.</p>

<p>Then, in the belfry she had duties other than
playing, than practice. Always at night the
clock-drum was to be wound.</p>

<p>She had no assistant. The town maintained
none, and her salary as Mistress of the Bells
of Sainte Lesse did not permit her to engage
anybody to help her.</p>

<p>So she oiled and wound all the machinery
herself, adjusted and cared for the clock, swept
the keyboard clean, inspected and looked after
the wires leading to the tiers of bells overhead.</p>

<p>Then there was work to do in the garden&mdash;a
few minutes snatched between other duties.
And when night arrived at last she was rather
tired&mdash;quite weary on this night in particular,<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>

having managed to fulfill all the duties of the
sick youth as well as her own.</p>

<p>The night was warm and fragrant. She
sat in the dark at her open window for a while,
looking out into the north where, along the
horizon, heat lightning seemed to play. But
it was only the reflected flashes of the guns.
When the wind was right, she could hear
them.</p>

<p>She had even managed to write to her lover.
Now, seated beside the open window, she was
thinking of him. A dreamy, happy lethargy
possessed her; she was on the first delicate
verge of slumber, so close to it that all earthly
sounds were dying out in her ears. Then, suddenly,
she was awake, listening.</p>

<p>A window had been opened in the room
overhead.</p>

<p>She went to the stars and called:</p>

<p>"Karl!"</p>

<p>"What?" came the impatient reply.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"No. N-no, I thank you&mdash;" His voice became
urbane with an apparent effort. "Thank
you for inquiring&mdash;&mdash;"<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/></p>

<p>"I heard your window open&mdash;" she said.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am quite well. The air is
mild and grateful.... I thank mademoiselle
for her solicitude."</p>

<p>She returned to her room and lighted her
candle. On the white plaster wall sat the
Death's Head moth.</p>

<p>She had not been in her room all day. She
was astonished that the moth had not left.</p>

<p>"Shall I have to put you out?" she thought
dubiously. "Really, I can not keep my window
closed for fear of visitors for you, Madam
Death! I certainly shall be obliged to put you
out."</p>

<p>So she found a sheet of paper and a large
glass tumbler. Over the moth she placed the
tumbler, then slipped the sheet of paper under
the glass between moth and wall.</p>

<p>The thing cried and cried, beating at the
glass with wings as powerful as a bird's, and
the girl, startled and slightly repelled, placed
the moth on her night table, imprisoned under
the tumbler.</p>

<p>For a while it fluttered and flapped and
cried out in its strange, uncanny way, then<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>

settled on the sheet of paper, quivering its
wings, both eyes like living coals.</p>

<p>Seated on the bedside, Maryette looked at it,
schooling herself to think of it kindly as one
of God's creatures before she released it at
her open window.</p>

<p>And, as she sat there, something came whizzing
into the room through her window, circled
around her at terrific speed with a humming,
whispering whirr, then dropped with a
solid thud on the night table beside the imprisoned
female moth.</p>

<p>It was the first suitor arrived from outer
darkness&mdash;a big, powerful Death's Head moth
with eyes aglow, the yellow skull displayed in
startling contrast on his velvet-black body.</p>

<p>The girl watched him, fascinated. He scrambled
over to the tumbler, tested it with heavy
antenn&aelig;; then, ardent and impatient, beat
against the glass with muscular wings that
clattered in the silence.</p>

<p>But it was not the amorous fury of the
creature striking the tumbler with resounding
wings, not the glowing eyes, the strong, clawed
feet, the Death's Head staring from its fune<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>real
black thorax that held the girl's attention.
It was something else; something entirely different
riveted her eyes on the creature.</p>

<p>For the cigar-shaped body, instead of bearing
the naked ribs of a skeleton, was snow
white.</p>

<p>And now she began to understand. Somebody
had already caught the moth, had
wrapped around its body a cylinder of white
tissue paper&mdash;tied it on with a fine, white
silk thread.</p>

<p>The moth was very still now, exploring the
interstices between tumbler and table with
heavy, pectinated antenn&aelig;.</p>

<p>Cautiously Maryette bent forward and
dropped both hands on the moth.</p>

<p>Instantly the creature cried out horribly; it
was like a mouse between her shrinking fingers;
but she slipped the cylinder of tissue
paper from its abdomen and released it with
a shiver; and it darted and whizzed around the
room, gyrating in whistling circles around her
head until, unnerved, she struck at it again
and again with empty hands, following, driv<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>ing
it toward the open window, out of which
it suddenly darted.</p>

<p>But now there was another Death's Head in
the room, a burly, headlong, infatuated male
which drove headlong at the tumbler and clung
to it, slipping, sliding, filling the room with
a feathery tattoo of wings.</p>

<p>It, also, had a snow-white body; and before
she had seized the squeaking thing and had
slipped the tissue wrapper from its body, another
Death's Head whirred through the window;
then another, then two; then others. The
room swarmed; they were crawling all over
the tumbler, the table, the bed. The room
was filled with the soft, velvety roar of whirring
wings beating on wall and ceiling and
against the tumbler where Madam Death sat
imprisoned, quivering her wings, her eyes two
molten rubies, and the ghastly skull staring
from her back.</p>

<p>How Maryette ever brought herself to do it;
how she did it at last, she had no very clear
idea. The touch of the slippery, mousy bodies
was fearsomely repugnant to her; the very
sight of the great, skull-bearing things began<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
to sicken her physically. A dreadful, almost
impalpable floss from their handled wings and
bodies smeared her hands; the place vibrated
with their tiny goblin cries.</p>

<p>Somehow she managed to strip them of the
tissue cylinders, drive them from where they
crawled on ceiling, wall and sill into whistling
flight. Amid a whirlwind of wings she fought
them toward the open window; whizzing, flitting,
circling they sped in widening spirals to
escape her blows, where she stood half blinded
in the vortex of the ghostly maelstrom.</p>

<p>One by one they darted through the open
window out into the night; and when the last
spectral streak of grey had sped into outer
darkness the girl slammed the windowpanes
shut and leaned against the sill enervated, exhausted,
revolted.</p>

<p>The room was misty with the microscopic
dust from the creatures' wings; on her palms
and fingers were black stains and stains of
livid orange; and across wall and ceiling
streaks and smudges of rusty colour.</p>

<p>She was still trembling when she washed the
smears from her hands. Her fingers were<pb n='289'/><anchor id='Pg289'/>
still unsteady as she smoothed out each tiny
sheet of tissue paper and laid it on her night
table. Then, seated on the bed's edge beside
the lighted candle, she began to read the messages
written in ink on these frail, translucent
tissue missives.</p>

<p>Every bit of tissue bore a message; the writing
was microscopic, the script German, the
language Flemish. Slowly, with infinite pains,
the little bell-mistress of Sainte Lesse translated
to herself each message as she deciphered
it.</p>

<p>She was trembling more than ever when she
finished. Every trace of colour had fled from
her cheeks.</p>

<p>Then, as she sat there, struggling to keep
her mind clear of the horror of the thing,
striving to understand what was to be done,
there came upon her window pane a sudden
muffled drumming sound, and her frightened
gaze fell upon a Death's Head moth outside,
its eyes like coals, its misty wings beating
furiously for admittance. And around its body
was tied a cylinder of white tissue.</p>

<p>But the girl needed no more evidence. The<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>
wretched youth in the room overhead had already
sealed his own doom with any one of
these tissue cylinders. Better for him if the
hemorrhage had slain him. Now a firing squad
must do that much for him.</p>

<p>Yet, even still, the girl hesitated, almost
incredulous, trying to comprehend the monstrous
grotesquerie of the abominable plot.</p>

<p>Intuition pointed to the truth; logic proved
it; somewhere in the German trenches a comrade
of this spy was awaiting these messages
with a caged Death's Head female as the bait&mdash;a
living loadstone wearing the terrific emblems
of death&mdash;an unfailing magnet to draw
the skull-bearing messengers for miles&mdash;had it
not been that a <hi rend='italic'>nearer magnet deflected them
in their flight!</hi></p>

<p>That was it! That was what the miserable
youth upstairs had not counted on. Chance
had ruined him; destiny had sent Madam Death
into the room below him to draw, with her
macabre charms, every ardent winged messenger
which he liberated from his bedroom
window.</p>

<p>The subtle effluvia permeating the night air<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>
for miles around might have guided these messengers
into the German trenches had not a
nearer and more imperious perfume annihilated
it. Headlong, amorous, impatient they
had whirled toward the embraces of Madam
Death; the nearer and more powerful perfume
had drawn the half-maddened, half-drugged
messengers. The spy in the room upstairs,
like many Germans, had reasoned wrongly on
sound premises. His logic had broken down,
not his amazing scientific foundation. His
theory was correct; his application stupid.</p>

<p>And now this young man was about to die.
Maryette understood that. She comprehended
that his death was necessary; that it was the
unavoidable sequence of what he had attempted
to do. Trapped rats must be drowned;
vermin exterminated by easiest and quickest
methods; spies who betray one's native land
pass naturally the same route.</p>

<p>But this thing, this grotesque, incredible, terrible
attempt to engraft treachery on one of
nature's most amazing laws&mdash;this secret, cunning
Teutonic reasoning, this scientific scoundrelism,
this criminal enterprise based on pa<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>tient,
plodding and German efficiency, still bewildered
the girl.</p>

<p>And yet she vaguely realized how science had
been already prostituted to Prussian malignancy
and fury; she had heard of flame jets,
of tear-bombs, of bombs containing deadly
germs; she herself had beheld the poison gas
rolling back into the trenches at Nivelle under
the town tower. Dimly she began to understand
that the Hun, in his cunning savagery,
had tricked, betrayed and polluted civilization
itself into lending him her own secrets with
which she was ultimately to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The very process of human thinking had
been imitated by these monkeys of Europe&mdash;apes
with the ferocity of hogs&mdash;and no souls,
none&mdash;nothing to lift them inside the pale
where dwells the human race.</p>

<p>There came a rapping on the caf&eacute; door.
The girl rose wearily; an immense weight
seemed to crush her shoulders so that her
knees had become unsteady.</p>

<p>She opened the caf&eacute; door; it was Sticky
Smith, come for his nightcap before turning
in.<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/></p>

<p>"The man upstairs is a German spy," she
said listlessly. "Had you not better go over
and get a gendarme?"</p>

<p>"Who's a spy? That Dutch shrimp you had
in your garden?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded the muleteer with
an oath.</p>

<p>She placed her lighted candle on the bar.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said. "Read these first&mdash;we
must be quite certain about what we do."</p>

<p>She laid the squares of tissue paper out on
the bar.</p>

<p>"Do you read Flemish?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I will translate into French for you.
And first of all I must tell you how I came to
possess these little letters written upon tissue.
Please listen attentively."</p>

<p>He rested his palm on the butt of his dangling
automatic.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said.</p>

<p>She told him the circumstances.</p>

<p>As she commenced to translate the tissue
paper messages in a low, tremulous voice, the<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
sound of a door being closed and locked in
the room overhead silenced her.</p>

<p>The next instant she had stepped out to the
stairs and called:</p>

<p>"Karl!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. Smith came out to the
stair-well and listened.</p>

<p>"It is his custom," she whispered, "to lock
his door before retiring. That is what we
heard."</p>

<p>"Call again."</p>

<p>"He can't hear me. He is in bed."</p>

<p>"Call, all the same."</p>

<p>"Karl!" she cried out in an unsteady voice.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII<lb/><lb/>
MADAM DEATH</head>

<p>There was no reply, because the young man
was hanging out over his window sill in the
darkness trying to switch away, from her
closed window below, the big, clattering
Death's Head moth which obstinately and persistently
fluttered there.</p>

<p>What possessed the moth to continue battering
its wings at the window of the room below?
Had the other moths which he released
done so, too? They had darted out of his
room into the night, each garnished with a
tissue robe. He supposed they had flown
north; he had not looked out to see.</p>

<p>What had gone wrong with this moth, then?</p>

<p>He took his emaciated blond head between
his bony fingers and pondered, probing for
reason with German thoroughness&mdash;that cele<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>brated
thoroughness which is invariably riddled
with flaws.</p>

<p>Of all contingencies he had thought&mdash;or so
it seemed to him. He could not recollect any
precaution neglected. He had come to Sainte
Lesse for a clearly defined object and to make
certain reports concerning matters of interest
to the German military authorities north of
Nivelle.</p>

<p>The idea, inspired by the experiments of
Henri Fabre, was original with him. Patiently,
during the previous year, he had worked
it out&mdash;had proved his theory by a series of
experiments with moths of this species.</p>

<p>He had arranged with his staff comrade,
Dr. Gl&uuml;ck, for a forced hatching of the pup&aelig;
which the latter had patiently bred from the
enormous green and violet-banded caterpillars.</p>

<p>At least one female Death's Head must be
ready, caged in the trenches beyond Nivelle.
Hundreds of pup&aelig; could not have died. Where,
then, was his error&mdash;if, indeed, he had made
any?</p>

<p>Leaning from the window, he looked down<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>
at the frantic moth, perplexed, a little uneasy
now.</p>

<p>"Swine!" he muttered. "What, then, ails you
that you do not fly to the mistress awaiting
you over yonder?"</p>

<p>He could see the cylinder of white tissue
shining on the creature's body, where it fluttered
against the pane, illuminated by the rays
of the candle from within the young girl's
room.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that the candle-light
was proving the greater attraction?</p>

<p>Even as the possibility entered his mind, he
saw another Death's Head dart at the window
below and join the first one. But this newcomer
wore no tissue jacket.</p>

<p>Then, out of the darkness the Death's Heads
began to come to the window below, swarms of
them, startling him with the racket of their
wings.</p>

<p>From where did they arrive? They could
not be the moths he liberated. But.... <hi rend='italic'>Were
they?</hi> Had some accident robbed their bodies
of the tissue missives? Had they blundered
into somebody's room and been robbed?<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/></p>

<p>Mystified, uneasy, he hung over his window
sill, staring with sickening eyes at the winged
tumult below.</p>

<p>With patient, plodding logic he began to
seek for the solution. What attracted these
moths to the room below? Was it the candle-light?
That alone could not be sufficient&mdash;could
not contend with the more imperious
attraction, the subtle effluvia stealing out of
the north and appealing to the ruling passion
which animated the frantic winged things below
him.</p>

<p>Patiently, methodically in his mind he probed
about for some clue to the solution. The ruling
passion animating the feathery whirlwind
below was the necessity for mating and perpetuating
the species.</p>

<p>That was the dominant passion; the lure
of candle-light a secondary attraction....
Then, if this were so&mdash;and it had been proven
to be a fact&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>what</hi> was in that
young girl's bedroom just below him?</p>

<p>Even as the question flashed in his mind
he left the window, went to his door, listened,
noiselessly unlocked it.<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/></p>

<p>A low murmur of voices came from the
caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>He drew off both shoes, descended the stairs
on the flat pads of his large, bony feet, listening
all the while.</p>

<p>Candle-light streamed out into the corridor
from her open bedroom door; and he crept to
the sill and peered in, searching the place with
small, pale eyes.</p>

<p>At first he noticed nothing to interest him,
then, all in an instant, his gaze fell upon
Madam Death under her prison of glass.</p>

<p>There she sat, her great bulging abdomen
distended with eggs, her lambent eyes shining
with the terrible passion of anticipation. For
one thing only she had been created. That
accomplished she died. And there she crouched
awaiting the fulfillment of her life's cycle with
the blazing eyes of a demon.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>From the caf&eacute; below came the cautious murmur
of voices. The young man already knew
what they were whispering about; or, if he
did not know he no longer cared.</p>

<p>The patches of bright colour in his sunken<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
cheeks had died out in an ashen pallor. As
far as he was concerned the world was now
ended. And he knew it.</p>

<p>He went into the bedroom and sat down
on the bed's edge. His little, pale eyes wandered
about the white room; the murmur of
voices below was audible all the while.</p>

<p>After a few moments' patient waiting, his
gaze rested again on Madam Death, squatting
there with wings sloped, and the skull and
bones staring at him from her head and distended
abdomen.</p>

<p>After all there was an odd resemblance between
himself and Madam Death. He had
been born to fulfill one function, it appeared.
So had she. And now, in his case as in hers,
death was immediately to follow. This was
sentiment, not science&mdash;the blind lobe of the
German brain balancing grotesquely the reasoning
lobe.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>The voices below had ceased. Presently he
heard a cautious step on the stair.</p>

<p>He had a little pill-box in his pocket. Methodically,
without haste, he drew it out, chose<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>
one white pellet, and, holding it between his
bony thumb and forefinger, listened.</p>

<p>Yes, somebody was coming up the stairs,
very careful to make no sound.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;there were various ways for a Death's
Head Hussar to die for his War Lord. All
were equally laudable. God&mdash;the God of Germany&mdash;the
celestial friend and comrade of his
War Lord&mdash;would presently correct him if he
was transgressing military discipline or the etiquette
of Kultur. As for the levelled rifles of
the execution squad, he preferred another way....

<hi rend='italic'>This</hi> way!...</p>

<p>His eyes were already glazing when the
burly form of Sticky Smith filled the doorway.</p>

<p>He looked down at Madam Death under the
tumbler beside him, then lifted his head and
gazed at Smith with blinded eyes.</p>

<p>"Swine!" he said complacently, swaying
gently forward and striking the floor with his
face.</p>

BUBBLES</head>

<p>An east wind was very likely to bring gas
to the trenches north of the Sainte Lesse salient.
A north wind, according to season,
brought snow or rain or fog upon British,
French, Belgian and Boche alike. Winds of
the south carried distant exhalations from
orchards and green fields into the pitted waste
of ashes where that monstrous desolation
stretched away beneath a thundering iron rain
which beat all day, all night upon the dead
flesh of the world.</p>

<p>But the west wind was the vital wind, flowing
melodiously through the trees&mdash;a clean,
aromatic, refreshing wind, filling the sickened
world with life again.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, it brought the pleasant
music of the bells into far-away trenches, when<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>

the little bell-mistress of Sainte Lesse played
the carillon. And when her friend, the great
bell, Bayard, spoke through the resounding sky
of France to a million men-at-arms in blue
and steel, who were steadily forging hell's
manacles for the uncaged Hun, the loyal western
wind carried far beyond the trenches an
ominous iron vibration that meant doom for
the Beast.</p>

<p>And the Beast heard, leering skyward out
of pale pig-eyes, but did not comprehend.</p>

<p>At the base corral down in the meadow,
mules had been scarce recently, because a
transport had been torpedoed. But the next
transport from New Orleans escaped; the
dusty column had arrived at Sainte Lesse from
the Channel port, convoyed by American muleteers,
as usual; new mules, new negroes, new
Yankee faces invaded the town once more.</p>

<p>However, it signified little to the youthful
mistress-of-the-bells, Maryette Courtray,
called "Carillonnette," for her Yankee lover
still lay in his distant hospital&mdash;her muleteer,
"Djack." So mules might bray, and negroes
fill the Sainte Lesse meadows with their shout<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>ing
laughter; and the lank, hawk-nosed Yankee
muleteers might saunter clanking into the
White Doe in search of meat or drink or
tobacco, or a glimpse of the pretty bell-mistress,
for all it meant to her.</p>

<p>Her Djack lived; that was what occupied
her mind; other men were merely men&mdash;even
his comrades, Sticky Smith and Kid Glenn,
assumed individuality to distinguish them
from other men only because they were Djack's
friends. And as for all other muleteers, they
seemed to her as alike as Chinamen, leaving
upon her young mind a general impression
of long, thin legs and necks and the keen
eyes of hunting falcons.</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>She had washing to do that morning. Very
early she climbed up into the ancient belfry,
wound the drum so that the bells would play
a few bars at the quarters and before each
hour struck; and also in order that the carillon
might ring mechanically at noon in case she
had not returned to take her place at the keyboard
with her wooden gloves.</p>

<p>There was a light west wind rippling through<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>
the tree tops; and everywhere sunshine lay
brilliant on pasture and meadow under the
purest of cobalt skies.</p>

<p>In the garden her crippled father, swathed
in shawls, dozed in his deep chair beside the
river-wall, waking now and then to watch the
quill on his long bamboo fish-pole, stemming
the sparkling current of the little river Lesse.</p>

<p>Sticky Smith, off duty and having filled himself
to repletion with caf&eacute;-au-lait at the inn,
volunteered to act as nurse, attendant, remover
of fish and baiter of hook, while Maryette
was absent at the stone-rimmed pool where
the washing of all Sainte Lesse laundry had
been accomplished for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>"You promise not to go away?" she cautioned
him in the simple, first-aid French she
employed in speaking to him, and pausing with
both arms raised to balance the loaded clothes-basket
on her head.</p>

<p>"Wee&mdash;wee!" he assured her with dignity.
"Je fume mong peep! Je regard le vieux
p&ecirc;cher. Voo poovay allay, Mademoiselle
Maryette."<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/></p>

<p>She hesitated, then removed the basket from
her head and set it on the grass.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Monsieur Steek-Smeet.
I shall wash your underwear the very first
garments I take out of my basket. Thank
you a thousand times." She bent over with
sweet solicitude and pressed her lips to her
father's withered cheek:</p>

<p>"Au revoir, my father <hi rend='italic'>ch&eacute;ri</hi>. An hour or
two at the meadow-<hi rend='italic'>lavoir</hi> and I shall return
to find thee. <hi rend='italic'>Bonne chance, mon p&egrave;re!</hi> Thou
shalt surely catch a large and beautiful fish
for luncheon before I return with my wash."</p>

<p>She swung the basket of wash to her head
again without effort, and went her way, following
the deeply trodden sheep-path behind
the White Doe Inn.</p>

<p>The path wound down through a sloping pasture,
across a footbridge spanning an arm of
the Lesse which washed the base of the garden
wall, then ascended a gentle aclivity among
hazel thicket and tall sycamores, becoming for
a little distance a shaded wood-path where
thrushes sang ceaselessly in the sun-flecked
undergrowth.<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/></p>

<p>But at the eastern edge of the copse the little
hill fell away into an open, sunny meadow,
fragrant with wild-flowers and clover, through
which a rivulet ran deep and cold between
grassy banks.</p>

<p>It supplied the drinking water of Sainte
Lesse; and a branch of it poured bubbling into
the stone-rimmed <hi rend='italic'>lavoir</hi> where generations of
Sainte Lesse maids had scrubbed the linen of
the community, kneeling there amid wild flowers
and fluttering butterflies in the shade of
three tall elms.</p>

<p>There was nobody at the pool; Maryette
saw that as she came out of the hazel copse
through the meadow. And very soon she was
on her knees at the clear pool's edge, bare of
arm and throat and bosom, her blue wool
skirts trussed up, and elbow deep in snowy
suds.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was a quivering, royal
blue; the earth shimmered in its bath of sunshine;
the west wind blowing carried away
eastward the reverberations of the distant
cannonade, so that not even the vibration of
the concussions disturbed Sainte Lesse.<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/></p>

<p>A bullfinch was piping lustily in a young
tree as she began her task; a blackbird answered
from somewhere among the hawthorns
with a bewildering series of complicated trills.</p>

<p>As the little mistress-of-the-bells scrubbed
and beat the clothes with her paddle, and
rinsed and wrung them and soaped them
afresh, she sang softly under her breath, to
an ancient air of her <hi rend='italic'>pays</hi>, words that she
improvised to fit it&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>vrai chanson de laveuse</hi>:</p>

<lg rend='stanza'>
<l>"A blackbird whistles</l>

<l rend='i20'>I love!</l>
<l>Over the thistles</l>
<l>Butterflies hover,</l>
<l>Each with her lover</l>
<l rend='i20'>In love.</l>
<l>Blue Demoiselles that glisten,</l>
<l rend='i20'>Listen, I love!</l>
<l>Wind of the west, oh, listen,</l>
<l rend='i20'>I am in love!</l>

<l>Sing my song, ye little gold bees!</l>
<l>Opal bubbles around my knees</l>
<l>All afloat in the soap-sud broth,</l>
<l>Whisper it low to the snowy froth;</l>
<l>And Thou who rulest the skies above,</l>
<l>Mary, adored&mdash;I love&mdash;I love!"</l>
</lg>

<p>Slap-slap! went her paddle; the sud-spume
flew like shreds of cotton; iridescent foam set<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>

with bubbles swirled in the stone-edged basin,
constantly swept away down stream by the
current, constantly renewed as she soaped and
scrubbed, kneeling there in the meadow grass
above the pool.</p>

<p>The blackbird came quite near to watch her;
the bullfinch, attracted by her childish voice
as she sang the song she was making, whistled
bold response, silent only when the echoing
slap of the paddle startled him where he sat
on the trembling tip of an aspen.</p>

<p>Blue dragon flies drifted on glimmering
wings; she put them into her song; the meadow
was gay with butterflies' painted wings; she
sang about them, too. Cloud and azure sky,
tree tops and clover, the tiny rivulet dancing
through deep grasses, the wind furrowing the
fields, all these she put into her <hi rend='italic'>chansonnette
de laveuse</hi>. And always in the clear glass of
the stream she seemed to see the smiling face
of her friend, Djack&mdash;her lover who had
opened her eyes of a child to all things beautiful
in the world.</p>

<p>Once or twice, from very far away, she
fancied she heard the distant singing of the<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>
negro muleteers sunning themselves down by
the corral. She heard, at quarter-hour intervals,
her bells melodiously recording time as it
sped by; then there were intervals of that
sweet stillness which is but a composite harmony
of summer&mdash;the murmur of insects, the
whisper of leaves and water, capricious seconds
of intense silence, then the hushed voice
of life exquisitely audible again.</p>

<p>War, wickedness, the rage and cruelty of the
Beast&mdash;all the vile and filthy ferocity of the
ferocious Swine of the North became to her as
unreal as a tragic legend half-forgotten. And
death seemed very far away.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>Her washing was done; the wet clothing
piled in her basket. Perspiration powdered
her forehead and delicate little nose.</p>

<p>Hot, flushed, breathing deeply and irregularly
from her efforts under a vertical sun,
she stood erect, loosening the blouse over her
bosom to the breeze and pushing back the clustering
masses of hair above her brow.</p>

<p>The water laughed up at her, invitingly; the
last floating castle of white foam swept past<pb n='311'/><anchor id='Pg311'/>
her feet down stream. On the impulse of the
moment she unlaced her blue wool skirt,
dropped it around her feet, stepped from it;
unbuckled both garters, stripped slippers and
stockings from her feet, and waded out into
the pool.</p>

<p>The fresh, delicious coolness of the water
thrilled and encouraged her to further adventure;
she twisted up her splendid hair, bound
it with her blue kerchief, flung blouse and
chemisette from her, and gave herself to the
sparkling stream with a sigh of ecstasy.</p>

<p>Alders swept the eastern edges of the current
where the rivulet widened beyond the
basin and ran south along the meadow's edge
to the Wood of Sainte Lesse&mdash;a cool, unruffled
flow, breast deep, floored with sand as soft as
silver velvet.</p>

<p>She waded, floated, swam a little, or, erect,
roamed leisurely along the alder fringe, exploring
the dim green haunts of frog and
water-hen, stoat and b&eacute;cassine&mdash;a slim, wet
dryad, gliding silently through sun and dappled
shadow.</p>

<p>Where the stream comes to Sainte Lesse<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>
Wood, there is a hill set thick with hazel and
clumps of fern, haunted by one roe-deer and
numerous rabbits and pheasants.</p>

<p>She was close to its base, now, gliding
through the shade like some lithe creature
of the forest; making no sound save where the
current curled around her supple body in
twisted necklaces of liquid light.</p>

<p>Then, as she stood, peering cautiously
through tangled branches for a glimpse of the
little roe-deer, she heard a curious sound up
on the hill&mdash;an inexplicable sound like metal
striking stone.</p>

<p>She stood as though frozen; clink, clink came
the distant sound. Then all was still. But
presently she saw a scared cock-pheasant,
crouching low with flattened neck outstretched,
run like a huge rat through the hazel growth,
out across the meadow.</p>

<p>She remained motionless, scarcely daring to
draw her breath. Somebody had passed over
the hill&mdash;if, indeed, he or she had actually continued
on their mysterious way. Had they?
But finally the intense quiet reassured her, and
she concluded that whoever had made that<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>
metallic sound had continued on toward Sainte
Lesse Wood.</p>

<p>She had taken with her a cake of soap.
Now, here in the green shade, she made her
ablutions, soaping herself from head to foot,
turning her head leisurely from time to time
to survey her leafy environment, or watch the
flight of some tiny woodland bird, or study
with pretty and speculative eyes the soap-suds
swirling in a dimpled whirlpool around her
thighs.</p>

<p>The bubbles fascinated her; she played with
them, capriciously, touching one here, one
there, with tentative finger to see them explode
in a tiny rainbow shower.</p>

<p>Finally she chose a hollow stem from among
a cluster of scented rushes, cleared it with a
vigorous breath, soaped one end, and, touching
it to the water, blew from it a prodigious
bubble, all swimming with gold and purple
hues.</p>

<p>Into the air she tossed it, from the end of
the hollow reed; the breeze caught it and
wafted it upward until it burst.</p>

<p><hi rend='italic'>Then a strange thing happened!</hi> Before her<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>
upturned eyes another bubble slowly arose
from a clump of aspens out of the hazel thickets
on the hill&mdash;a big, pearl-tinted, translucent
bubble, as large as a melon. Upward it floated,
slowly ascending to the tree-tops. There the
wind caught it, drove it east, but it still
mounted skyward, higher, higher, sailing always
eastward, until it dwindled to the size
of a thistledown and faded away in mid-air.</p>

<p>Astounded, the little mistress-of-the-bells
stood motionless, waist deep in the stream, lips
parted, eyes straining to pierce the dazzling
ether above.</p>

<p>And then, before her incredulous gaze, another
pearl-tinted, translucent bubble slowly
floated upward from the thicket near the aspens,
mounted until the breeze struck it, then
soared away skyward and melted like a snowflake
into the east.</p>

<p>Moving as stealthily as some sinuous creature
of the water-weeds, the girl stole forward,
threading her way among the rushes, gliding,
twisting around tussock and alder, creeping
along fern-set banks, her eyes ever focused on<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>
the clump of aspens quivering against the sky
above the hazel.</p>

<p>She could see nobody, hear not a sound from
the thicket on the little hill. But another bubble
rose above the aspens as she looked.</p>

<p>Naked, she dared not advance into the woods&mdash;scarcely
dared linger where she was, yet
found enough courage to creep out on a carpet
of moss and lie flat under a young fir,
listening and watching.</p>

<p>No more bubbles rose above the aspens;
there was not a sound, not a movement in the
hazel.</p>

<p>For an hour or more she lay there; then,
with infinite caution, she slipped back into the
stream, waded across, crept into the meadow,
and sped like a scared fawn along the bank
until she stood panting by the stone-rimmed
pool again.</p>

<p>Sun and wind had dried her skin; she
dressed rapidly, swung her basket to her head,
and started swiftly for Sainte Lesse.</p>

<p>Before she came in sight of the White Doe
Tavern, she could hear the negro muleteers
singing down by the corral.<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>
Sticky Smith still squatted in the garden
by the river-wall, smoking his pipe. Her father
lay asleep in his chair, his wrinkled hands
still clasping the fishing pole, the warm breeze
blowing his white hair at the temples.</p>

<p>She disposed of the wash; then she and
Sticky Smith gently aroused the crippled bell-master
and aided him into the house.</p>

<p>The old peasant woman who cooked for the
inn had soup ready. The noonday meal in
Sainte Lesse had become an extremely simple
affair.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Steek," said the girl carelessly,
"did you ever, as a child, fly toy balloons?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Maryette. A old Eyetalian wop used
to come 'round town selling them. He had a
stick with about a hundred little balloons tied
to it&mdash;red, blue, green, yellow&mdash;all kinds and
colours. Whenever I had the price I bought
one."</p>

<p>"Did it fly?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The gas in it wasn't much good unless
you got a fresh one."</p>

<p>"Would it fly high?"<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/></p>

<p>"Sure. Sky-high. I've seen 'em go clean out
of sight when you got a fresh one."</p>

<p>"Nobody uses them here, do they?"</p>

<p>"Here? No, it wouldn't be allowed. A spy
could send a message by one of those toy balloons."</p>

<p>"Oh," nodded Maryette thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Smith shook his head:</p>

<p>"No, children wouldn't be permitted to play
with them things now, Maryette."</p>

<p>"Then there are not any toy balloons to be
had here in Sainte Lesse?"</p>

<p>"I rather guess not! Farther north there
are."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"The artillery uses them."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. The balloon and flying service
use 'em, too. I've seen officers send them
up. Probably it is to find out about upper air
currents."</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Our</hi> flying service?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Ballons d'essai</hi>," she nodded carelessly.<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>

But she was not yet entirely convinced regarding
the theory she was pondering.</p>

<p>After lunch she continued to be very busy
in the laundry for a time, but the memory of
those three little balloons above the aspens
troubled her.</p>

<p>Smith had gone on duty at the corral; Kid
Glenn sauntered clanking into the bar and was
there regaled with a <hi rend='italic'>bock</hi> and a <hi rend='italic'>tranche</hi>.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Keed," said Maryette, "are any
of our airmen in Sainte Lesse today?"</p>

<p>Glenn drained his glass and smacked his
lips:</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," he said.</p>

<p>"No balloonists, either?"</p>

<p>"I don't guess so, Maryette. We've got the
Boche flyers scared stiff. They don't come over
our first lines anymore, and our own people
are out yonder."</p>

<p>"Keed," she said, winningly sweet, "do you,
in fact, love me a little&mdash;for Djack's sake?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"I borrow of you that automatic pistol.
Yes?" She smiled at him engagingly.<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/></p>

<p>"Sure. Anything you want! What's the
trouble, Maryette?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her pretty shoulders:</p>

<p>"Nothing. It just came into my cowardly
head that the path to the <hi rend='italic'>lavoir</hi> is lonely at
sundown. And there are new muleteers in
Sainte Lesse. And I must wash my clothes."</p>

<p>"I reckon," he said gravely, unbuckling his
weapon-filled holster and quietly strapping it
around her shoulder with its pocketed belt of
clips.</p>

<p>"You will not require it this afternoon?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"No fear. You won't either. Them mule-whacking
coons is white."</p>

<p>She understood.</p>

<p>"Some men who seem whitest are blacker
than any negro," she remarked. "<hi rend='italic'>Eh, bien!</hi>
I thank you, Keed, <hi rend='italic'>mon ami</hi>, for your complaisance.
You are very amiable to submit to
the whim of a silly girl who suddenly becomes
afraid of her own shadow."</p>

<p>Glenn grinned and glanced significantly at
the cross dangling from her bosom:</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, "your government decorates<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>
cowards. That's why it gave you the Legion."</p>

<p>She blushed but looked up at him seriously:</p>

<p>"Keed, if I flew a little toy balloon in the
air, where would the west wind carry it?"</p>

<p>"Into the Boche trenches," he replied, much
interested in the idea. "If you've got one,
we'll paint 'To hell with Willie' on it and set
it afloat! But we'll have to get permission
from the gendarmes first."</p>

<p>She said, smiling:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I haven't any toy balloons."</p>

<p>She picked up her basket with its new load
of soiled linen, swung it gracefully to her
head, ignoring his offered assistance, gave him
a beguiling glance, and went away along the
sheep-path.</p>

<p>Once more she followed the deep-trodden and
ancient trail through copse and pasture and
over the stream down into the meadow, where
the west wind furrowed the wild-flowers and
the early afternoon sun fell hot.</p>

<p>She set her clothes to soak, laid paddle
and soap beside them, then, straightening up,
remained erect on her knees, her intent gaze
fixed on the distant clump of aspens, delicate<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>
as mist above the hazel copse on the little
hill beyond.</p>

<p>It was a whole hour before her eyes caught
the high glimmer of a tiny balloon. Only
for a moment was it visible at that distance,
then it became merged in the dazzling blue
above the woods.</p>

<p>She waited. At last she concluded that there
were to be no more balloons. Then a sudden
fear assailed her lest she had waited too long
to investigate; and she sprang to her feet,
hurried over the single plank used as a footbridge,
and sped down through the alders.</p>

<p>Here and there a pheasant ran headlong
across her path; a rabbit or two scuttled
through the ferns. Nearing the hazel copse
she slackened speed and advanced with caution,
scanning the thicket ahead.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on the ground in front of her,
she caught sight of a small iron cylinder. Evidently
it had rolled down there from the slope
above.</p>

<p>Very gingerly she approached and picked it
up. It was not very heavy, not too big for
her skirt pocket.<pb n='322'/><anchor id='Pg322'/></p>

<p>As she slipped it into the pocket of her
blue woolen peasant-skirt, her quick eye caught
a movement among the hazel bushes on the
hillside to her right. She sank to the ground
and lay huddled there.</p>

<p>Down the slope, through the thicket, came a
man. She could see his legs only. He wore
dust-coloured breeches and tan puttees, like
Sticky Smith's and Kid Glenn's, only he wore
no big, clanking Mexican spurs.</p>

<p>The man passed in front of her, his burly
body barely visible through the leaves, but
not his features.</p>

<p>She rose, turned, ran over the moss, hurried
through the ferns of the warren, retracing
her steps, and arrived breathless at the <hi rend='italic'>lavoir</hi>.
And scarcely had she dropped to her knees
and seized soap and paddle, than a squat,
bronzed, powerfully built young man appeared
on the opposite bank of the stream, stepping
briskly out of the bushes.</p>

<p>He did not notice her at first. He looked<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>
about for a place to jump, found one, leaped
safely across, and came on at a swinging stride
across the meadow.</p>

<p>The girl, bending above the water, suddenly
struck sharply with her paddle.</p>

<p>Instantly the man halted in his tracks, knee
deep in clover.</p>

<p>Maryette, apparently unconscious of his presence,
continued to soap and scrub and slap her
wash, singing in her clear, untrained voice of
a child the chansonette she had made that
morning. But out of the corner of her eyes
she kept him in view&mdash;saw him come sauntering
forward as though reassured, became
aware that he had approached very near, was
standing behind her.</p>

<p>Turning presently, where she knelt, to pick
up another soiled garment, she suddenly encountered
his dark gaze; and her start and
slight exclamation were entirely genuine.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Mon Dieu!</hi>" she said, with offended emphasis,
"one does not approach people that way,
without a word!"</p>

<p>"Did I frighten mademoiselle?" he asked,
in recognizable French, but with an accent<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>
unpleasantly familiar to her. "If I did, I am
very sorry and I offer mademoiselle a thousand
excuses and apologies."</p>

<p>The girl, kneeling there in the clover,
flashed a smile at him over her shoulder.
The quick colour reddened his face and powerful
neck. The girl had been right; her
smile had been an answer that he was not
going to ignore.</p>

<p>"What a pretty spot for a <hi rend='italic'>lavoir</hi>," he said,
stepping to the edge of the pool; "and what
a pretty girl to adorn it!"</p>

<p>Maryette tossed her head:</p>

<p>"Be pleased to pass your way, monsieur.
Do you not perceive that I am busy?"</p>

<p>"It is not impossible to exchange a polite
word or two when people are busy, is it,
mademoiselle?" he asked, laughing and showing
a white and perfect set of teeth under a
short, dark mustache.</p>

<p>She continued to wring out her wash; but
there was now a slight smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"May I not say who I am?" he asked persuasively.
"May I not venture to speak?"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Mon dieu</hi>, monsieur, there is liberty of<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>
speech for all in France. That blackbird
might be glad to know your name if you
choose to tell him."</p>

<p>"But I ask <hi rend='italic'>your</hi> permission to speak to

<hi rend='italic'>you</hi>!" There seemed to be no sense of humour
in this young man.</p>

<p>She laughed:</p>

<p>"I am not curious to hear who you are!...
But if it affords you any relief to explain
to the west wind what your name may
be&mdash;" She ended with a disdainful shrug.
After a moment she lifted her pretty eyes
to his&mdash;lovely, provocative, tormenting eyes.
But they were studying the stranger closely.</p>

<p>He was a powerfully built, dark-skinned
young man in the familiar khaki of the American
muleteers, wearing their insignia, their
cap, their holster and belt, and an extra
pouch or wallet, loaded evidently with something
heavy.</p>

<p>She said, coolly:</p>

<p>"You must be one of the new Yankee muleteers
who came with that beautiful new herd
of mules."</p>

<p>He laughed:<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/></p>

<p>"Yes, I'm an American muleteer. My name
is Charles Braun. I came over in the last
transport."</p>

<p>"You know Steek?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Steek! Monsieur Steekee Smeete?"</p>

<p>"Sticky Smith?"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Mais oui?</hi>"</p>

<p>"I've met him," he replied curtly.</p>

<p>"And Monsieur Keed Glenn?"</p>

<p>"I've met Kid Glenn, too. Why?"</p>

<p>"They are friends of mine&mdash;very intimate
friends. Of course," she added, nose up-tilted,
"if they are not also <hi rend='italic'>your</hi> friends, any
acquaintance with me will be very difficult
for <hi rend='italic'>you</hi>, Monsieur Braun."</p>

<p>He laughed easily and seated himself on
the grass beside her; and, as he sat down, a
metallic clinking sounded in his wallet.</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Tenez</hi>," she remarked, "you carry old iron
and bottles about with you, I notice."</p>

<p>"Snaffles, curbs and stirrup irons," he replied
carelessly. And in the girl's heart there
leaped the swift, fierce flame of certainty in
suspicion.<pb n='328'/><anchor id='Pg328'/></p>

<p>"Why do you bring all that ironmongery
down here?" she inquired, with frankly childish
curiosity, leisurely wringing out her linen.</p>

<p>"A mule got away from the corral. I've
been wandering around in the bushes trying
to find him," he explained, so naturally and
in such a friendly voice that she raised her
eyes to look again at this young gallant who
lingered here at the <hi rend='italic'>lavoir</hi> for the sake of her
<hi rend='italic'>beaux yeux</hi>.</p>

<p>Could this dark-eyed, smiling youth be a
Hun spy? His smooth, boyish features, his
crisp short hair and tiny mustache shading
lips a trifle too red and overfull did not displease
her. In his way he was handsome.</p>

<p>His voice, too, was attractive, gaily persuasive,
but it was his pronunciation of the
letters c and d which had instantly set her
on her guard.</p>

<p>Seated on the bank near her, his roving
eyes full of bold curiosity bent on her from
time to time, his idle fingers plaiting a little
wreath out of long-stemmed clover and <hi rend='italic'>boutons
d'or</hi>, he appeared merely an intrusive,
irresponsible young fellow willing to amuse<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>
himself with a few moments' rustic courtship
here before he continued on his way.</p>

<p>"You are exceedingly pretty," he said.
"Will you tell me your name in exchange for
mine?"</p>

<p>"Maryette Courtray."</p>

<p>"Oh," he exclaimed in quick recognition;
"you are bell-mistress in Sainte Lesse, then!
<hi rend='italic'>You</hi> are the celebrated carillonnette! I have
heard about you. I suspected that you might
be the little mistress of Sainte Lesse bells, because
you wear the Legion&mdash;" He nodded his
handsome head toward the decoration on her
blouse.</p>

<p>"And to think," he added effusively, "that
it is just a mere slip of a girl who was decorated
for bravery by France!"</p>

<p>She smiled at him with all the beguilingly
<hi rend='italic'>b&ecirc;te</hi> innocence of the young when flattered:</p>

<p>"You are too amiable, monsieur. I really
do not understand why they gave me the
Legion. To encourage all French children,
perhaps&mdash;because I really am a dreadful coward."
She tapped the holster on her thigh
and gazed at him quite guilelessly out of wide<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>
and trustful eyes. "You see? I dare not
even come here to wash my clothes unless I
carry this&mdash;in case some Boche comes prowling."</p>

<p>"Whose pistol is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The weapon belongs to Monsieur Steek.
When I come to wash here I borrow it."</p>

<p>"Are you the sweetheart of Monsieur
Steek?" he inquired, mimicking her pronunciation
of "Stick," and at the same time fixing
his dark eyes boldly and expressively on hers.</p>

<p>"Does a young girl of my age have sweethearts?"
she demanded scornfully.</p>

<p>"If she hasn't had one, it's time," he returned,
staring hard at her with a persistent
and fixed smile that had become almost
offensive.</p>

<p>"Oh, la!" she exclaimed with a shrug of her
youthful shoulders. "Perhaps you think I
have time for such foolishness&mdash;what with
housework to do and washing, and caring for
my father, and my duties in the belfry every
day!"</p>

<p>"Youth passes swiftly, belle Maryette."<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/></p>

<p>"Imitate him, beau monsieur, and swiftly
pass your way!"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>L'amour est doux, petite Marie!</hi>"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Je m'en moque!</hi>"</p>

<p>He rose, smiling confidently, dropped on his
knees beside her, and rolled back his cuffs.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "I'll help you wash. We
two should finish quickly."</p>

<p>"I am in no haste."</p>

<p>"But it will give you an hour's leisure, belle
Maryette."</p>

<p>"Why should I wish for leisure, beau monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I shall try to instruct you why, when we
have our hour together."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to pay court to me?"</p>

<p>"I am doing that now. My ardent courtship
will already be accomplished, so that we
need not waste our hour together!" He began
to laugh and wring out the linen.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she expostulated smilingly,
"your apropos disturbs me. Have you the
assurance to believe that you already appeal
to my heart?"<pb n='332'/><anchor id='Pg332'/></p>

<p>"Have I not appealed to it a little, Maryette?"</p>

<p>The girl averted her head coquettishly.
For a few minutes they scrubbed away there
together, side by side on their knees above
the rim of the pool. Then, without warning,
his hot, red lips burned her neck. Her
swift recoil was also a shudder; her face
flushed.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" she said sharply, straightening
up in the grass where she was kneeling.</p>

<p>"You are so adorable!" he pleaded in a low,
tense voice.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. She had moved
aside and away from him on her knees; her
head remained turned, too, and her features
were set as though carven out of rosy marble.</p>

<p>She was summoning every atom of resolution,
every particle of courage to do what she
must do. Every fibre in her revolted with
the effort; but she steeled herself, and at last
the forced smile was stamped on her lips, and
she dared turn her head and meet his burning
gaze.</p>

<p>"You frighten me," she said&mdash;and her un<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>steady
voice was convincing. "A young girl
is not courted so abruptly."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he murmured. "I could not
help myself&mdash;your neck is so fragrant, so
childlike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you should treat me as you would a
child!" she retorted pettishly. "Amuse me,
if you aspire to any comradeship with me.
Your behaviour does not amuse me at all."</p>

<p>"We shall become comrades," he said confidently,
"and you shall be sufficiently amused."</p>

<p>"It requires time for two people to become
comrades."</p>

<p>"Will you give me an hour this evening?"</p>

<p>"What? A rendezvous?" she exclaimed,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You mean somewhere alone with you?"</p>

<p>"Will you, Maryette?"</p>

<p>"But why? I am not yet old enough for
such foolishness. It would not amuse me at
all to be alone with you for an hour." She
pouted and shrugged and absently plucked a
hollow stem from the sedge.</p>

<p>"It would amuse me much more to sit here<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>

and blow bubbles," she added, clearing the
stem with a quick breath and soaping the
end of it.</p>

<p>Then, with tormenting malice, she let her
eyes rest sideways on him while she plunged
the hollow stem into the water, withdrew it,
dripping, and deliberately blew an enormous
golden bubble from the end.</p>

<p>"Look!" she cried, detaching the bubble, apparently
enchanted to see it float upward. "Is
it not beautiful, my fairy balloon?"</p>

<p>On her knees there beside the basin she
blew bubble after bubble, detaching each with
a slight movement of her wrist, and laughing
delightedly to see them mount into the sunshine.</p>

<p>"You <hi rend='italic'>are</hi> a child," he said, worrying his red
underlip with his teeth. "You're a baby, after
all."</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"Very well, then, children require toys to
amuse them, not sighs and kisses and bold,
brown eyes to frighten and perplex them.
Have you any toys to amuse me if I give you
an hour with me?"<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/></p>

<p>"Maryette, I can easily teach you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! Will you bring me a toy to amuse
me?&mdash;a clay pipe to blow bubbles? I adore
bubbles."</p>

<p>"If I promise to amuse you, will you give
me an hour?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How can I?" she demanded with sudden
caprice. "I have my wash to finish; then I
have to see that my father has his soup; then
I must attend to customers at the inn, go up
to the belfry, oil the machinery, play the
carillon later, wind the drum for the
night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall come to you in the tower after the
angelus," he said eagerly.</p>

<p>"I shall be too busy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After the carillon, then! Promise, Maryette!"</p>

<p>"And sit up there alone with you in the
dark for an hour? <hi rend='italic'>Ma foi!</hi> How amusing!"
She laughed in pretty derision. "I shall not
even be able to blow bubbles!"</p>

<p>Watching her pouting face intently, he said:</p>

<p>"Suppose I bring some toy balloons for you<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
to fly from the clock tower? Would that
amuse you&mdash;you beautiful, perverse child?"</p>

<p>"Little toy balloons!" she echoed, enchanted.
"What pleasure to set them afloat from the
belfry! Do you really promise to bring me
some little toy balloons to fly?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But <hi rend='italic'>you</hi> must promise not to speak
about it to anybody."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the gendarmes wouldn't let us fly
any balloons."</p>

<p>"You mean that they might think me a
spy?" she inquired na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>"Or me," he rejoined with a light laugh.
"So we shall have to be very discreet and go
cautiously about our sport. And it ought to
be great fun, Maryette, to sail balloons out
over the German trenches. We'll tie a message
to every one! Shall we, little comrade?"</p>

<p>She clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"That <hi rend='italic'>will</hi> enrage the Boches!" she cried,
"You won't forget to bring the balloons?"</p>

<p>"After the carillon," he nodded, staring at
her intently.</p>

<p>"Half past ten," she said; "not one minute<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
earlier. I cannot be disturbed when playing.
Do you understand? Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I promise not to bother
you before half past ten."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now let me do my washing
here in peace."</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>She was still scrubbing her linen when he
went reluctantly away across the meadow
toward Sainte Lesse. And when she finally
stood up, swung the basket to her head, and
left the meadow, the sun hung low behind
Sainte Lesse Wood and a rose and violet glow
possessed the world.</p>

<p>At the White Doe Inn she flew feverishly
about her duties, aiding the ancient peasant
woman with the simple preparations for dinner,
giving her father his soup and helping
him to bed, swallowing a mouthful herself as
she hastened to finish her household tasks.</p>

<p>Kid Glenn came in as usual for an <hi rend='italic'>aperitif</hi>
while she was gathering up her wooden
gloves.</p>

<p>"Did a mule stray today from your corral?"
she asked, filling his glass for him.<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/></p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Dead certain. Why?"</p>

<p>"Do you know one of the new muleteers
named Braun?"</p>

<p>"I know him by sight."</p>

<p>"Keed!" she said, going up to him and placing
both hands on his broad shoulders; "I
play the carillon after the angelus. Bring
Steek to the bell-tower half an hour after you
hear the carillon end. You will hear it end;
you will hear the quarter hour strike presently.
Half an hour later, after the third
quarter hour strikes, you shall arrive. Bring
pistols. Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"Sure! What's the row, Maryette?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. I <hi rend='italic'>think</hi> we shall find a
spy in the tower."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the belfry, <hi rend='italic'>parbleu</hi>! And you and
Steek shall come up the stairs and you shall
wait in the dark, there where the keyboard
is, and where you see all the wires leading
upward. You shall listen attentively, and
I will be on the landing above, among my<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>

bells. And when you hear me cry out to you,
then you shall come running with pistols!"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it understood? Give me your word,
Keed!"</p>

<p>"Sure!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Allons! Assez!</hi>" she whispered excitedly.
"Make prisoner any man you see there!&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>any</hi>

man! You understand?"</p>

<p>"You bet!"</p>

<p>"<hi rend='italic'>Any man!</hi>" she repeated slowly, "even if
he wears the same uniform <hi rend='italic'>you</hi> wear."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then:</p>

<p>"By God!" said Glenn under his breath.</p>

<p>"You suspect?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And if it <hi rend='italic'>is</hi> one of our German-American
muleteers, we'll lynch him!" he
whispered in a white rage.</p>

<p>But Maryette shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said in a dull, even voice, "let the
gendarmerie take him in charge. Spy or suspect,
he must have his chance. That is the
law in France."</p>

<p>"You don't give rats a chance, do you?"<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/></p>

<p>"I give everything its chance," she said
simply. "And so does my country."</p>

<p>She drew the automatic pistol from her
holster, examined it, raised her eyes gravely
to the American beside her:</p>

<p>"This is terrible for me," she added, in a
low but steady voice. "If it were not for
my country&mdash;" She made a grave gesture,
turned, and went slowly out through the
arched stone passage into the main street of
the town. A few minutes later the angelus
sounded sweetly over the woods and meadows
of Sainte Lesse.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>At ten, as the last stroke of the hour ended,
there came a charming, intimate little murmur
of awakening bells; it grew sweeter,
clearer, filling the starry sky, growing, exquisitely
increasing in limpid, transparent volume,
sweeping through the high, dim belfry
like a great wind from Paradise carrying
Heaven's own music out over the darkened
earth.</p>

<p>All Sainte Lesse came to its doorways to
listen to the playing of their beloved Carillon<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>nette;
the bell-music ebbed and swelled under
the stars; the ancient Flemish masterpiece,
written by some carillonneur whose bones had
long been dust, became magnificently vital
again under the enchanted hands of the little
mistress of the bells.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes the carillon ended; a
slight pause followed, then the quarter hour
struck.</p>

<p>With the last stroke of the bell, the girl
drew off her wooden gloves, laid them on the
keyboard, turned slowly in her seat, listening.
A slight sound coming from the spiral staircase
of stone set her heart beating violently.
Had the suspected man violated his word?
She drew the automatic pistol from her holster,
rose, and stole up to the stone platform
overhead, where, rising tier on tier into the
darkness, the great carillon of Sainte Lesse
loomed overhead.</p>

<p>She listened uneasily. Had the man lied?
It seemed to her as though her hammering
heart must burst from her bosom with the
terrible suspense of the moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shadowy form appeared at the<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>
head of the stairs, reaching the platform at
one bound. And her heart seemed to stop as
she realized that this man had arrived too
early for her friends to be of any use to her.
He had lied to her. And now she must take
him unaided, or kill him there in the starlight
under the looming bells.</p>

<p>"Maryette!" he called. She did not stir.</p>

<p>"Maryette!" he whispered. "Where are
you, little sweetheart? Forgive me, I could
not wait any longer. I adore you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>All at once he discovered her standing motionless
in the shadow of the great bell Bayard&mdash;sprang
toward her, eager, ardent, triumphant.</p>

<p>"Maryette," he whispered, "I love you! I
shall teach you what a lover is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught a glimpse of her face;
the terrible expression in her eyes checked
him.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked, bewildered.
And then he caught sight of the pistol
in her hand.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" he demanded harshly.
"Are you afraid to love me? Do you think<pb n='343'/><anchor id='Pg343'/>
I'm the kind of lover to stop for a thing like
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said, in a low, distinct voice:</p>

<p>"Don't move! Put up both hands instantly!"</p>

<p>"What!" he snapped out, like the crack of
a lash.</p>

<p>"I know who you are. You're a Boche and
no Yankee! Turn your back and raise your
arms!"</p>

<p>For a moment they looked at each other.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, steadily, "you had better
explain your gas cylinders and balloons
to the gendarmes at the Poste."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I'll explain them to you,
<hi rend='italic'>now</hi>!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you touch your pistol, I fire!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But already he had whipped out his pistol;
and she fired instantly, smashing his right
hand to pulp.</p>

<p>"You damned hell-cat!" he screamed,
stretching out his shattered hand in an agony
of impotent fury. Blood rained from it on
the stone flags. Suddenly he started toward
her.<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/></p>

<p>"Don't stir!" she whispered. "Turn your
back and raise both arms!"</p>

<p>His face became ghastly.</p>

<p>"Let me go, in God's name!" he burst out
in a strangled voice. "Don't send me before
a firing squad! Listen to me, little comrade&mdash;I
surrender myself to your mercy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then keep away from me! Keep your
distance!" she cried, retreating. He followed,
fawning:</p>

<p>"Listen! We were such good comrades&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't come any nearer to me!" she called
out sharply; but he still shuffled toward her,
whimpering, drenched in blood, both hands
uplifted.</p>

<p>"Kamerad!" he whined, "Kamerad&mdash;" and
suddenly launched a kick at her.</p>

<p>She just avoided it, springing behind the
bell Bayard; and he rushed at her and struck
with both uplifted arms, showering her with
blood, but not quite reaching her.</p>

<p>In the darkness among the beams and the
deep shadows of the bells she could hear him
hunting for her, breathing heavily and mak<pb n='345'/><anchor id='Pg345'/>ing
ferocious, inarticulate noises, as she
swung herself up onto the first beam above
and continued to crawl upward.</p>

<p>"Where are you, little fool?" he cried at
length. "I have business with you before I
cut your throat&mdash;that smooth, white throat of
yours that I kissed down there by the <hi rend='italic'>lavoir</hi>!"
There was no sound from her.</p>

<p>He went back toward the stairs and began
hunting about in the starlight for his pistol;
but there was no parapet on the bell platform,
and he probably concluded that it had fallen
over the edge of the tower into the street.</p>

<p>Supporting his wounded hand, he stood
glaring blankly about him, and his bloodshot
eyes presently fell on the door to the stairs.
But he must have realized that flight would
be useless for him if he left this girl alive in
her bell-tower, ready to alarm the town the
moment he ran for the stairs.</p>

<p>With his left hand he fumbled under his
tunic and disengaged a heavy trench knife
from its sheath. The loss of blood was making
his legs a trifle unsteady, but he pulled
himself together and moved stealthily under<pb n='346'/><anchor id='Pg346'/>
the shadows of beam and bell until he came
to the spot he selected. And there he lay
down, the hilt of the knife in his left hand,
the blade concealed by his opened tunic.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>His heavy groans at last had their effect
on the girl, who had climbed high up into the
darkness, creeping from beam to beam and
mounting from one tier of bells to another.</p>

<p>Standing on the lowest beam, she cautiously
looked out through an oubliette and saw him
lying on his back near the sheer edge of the
roof.</p>

<p>Evidently he, also, could see her head silhouetted
against the stars, for he called up
to her in a plaintive voice that he was bleeding
to death and unable to move.</p>

<p>After a few moments, opening his eyes
again, he saw her standing on the roof beside
him, looking down at him. And he whispered
his appeal in the name of Christ. And in
His name the little bell-mistress responded.</p>

<p>When she had used the blue kerchief at her
neck for a tourniquet and had checked the
hemorrhage, he was still patiently awaiting a<pb n='347'/><anchor id='Pg347'/>
better opportunity to employ his knife. It
would not do to bungle the affair. And he
thought he knew how it could be properly
done&mdash;if he could get her head in the crook
of his muscular elbow.</p>

<p>"Lift me, dear ministering angel," he whispered
weakly.</p>

<p>She stooped impulsively, hesitated, then,
suddenly terrified at the blazing ferocity in
his eyes, she shrank back at the same instant
that his broad knife flashed in her very face.</p>

<p>He was on his feet at a bound, and, as she
raised her voice in a startled cry for help,
he plunged heavily at her, but slipped and fell
in his own blood. Then the clattering jingle
of spurred boots on the stone stairs below
caught his ear. He was trapped, and he
realized it. He slowly got to his feet.</p>

<p>As Smith and Glenn appeared, springing
out of the low-arched door, the muleteer
Braun turned and faced them.</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Glenn said,
bitterly:</p>

<p>"It's you, is it, you dirty Dutchman!"</p>

<p>"Hands up!" said Smith quietly. "Come<pb n='348'/><anchor id='Pg348'/>
on, now; it's a case of 'Kamerad' for yours."</p>

<p>Braun did not move to comply with the
demand. Gradually it dawned on them that
the man was game.</p>

<p>"Maryette!" he called; "where are you?"</p>

<p>Smith said curiously:</p>

<p>"What do you want with her, Braun?"</p>

<p>"I want to speak to her."</p>

<p>"Come over here, Maryette," said Glenn
sullenly.</p>

<p>The girl crept out of the shadows. Her
face was ghastly.</p>

<p>Braun looked at her with pallid scorn:</p>

<p>"You little, ignorant fool," he said, "I'd have
made you a better lover than you'll ever have
now!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his square shoulders in contempt,
turned without a glance at Smith and
Glenn, and stepped outward into space. And
as he fell there between sky and earth, hurtling
downward under the stars, Glenn's pistol
flashed twice, killing his quarry in midair
while falling.</p>

<p>"Can you beat it?" he demanded hoarsely,
turning on Smith. "Ain't that me all over<pb n='349'/><anchor id='Pg349'/>!&mdash;soft-hearted
enough to do that skunk a kindness
thataway!"</p>

<p>But his youthful voice was shaking, and he
stared at the edge of the abyss, listening to
the far tumult now arising from the street
below.</p>

<p>"Did you shoot?" he inquired, controlling
his nervous voice with an effort.</p>

<p>"Naw," said Smith disgustedly. "... Now,
Maryette, put one arm around my neck, and
me and the Kid will take you down them
stairs, because you look tired&mdash;kind o' peeked
and fussed, what with all this funny business
going on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Steek! Steek!" she sobbed. "Oh, <hi rend='italic'>mon
ami</hi>, Steek!"</p>

<p>She began to cry bitterly. Smith picked
her up in his arms.</p>

<p>"What you need is sleep," he said very
gently.</p>

<p>But she shook her head: she had business
to transact on her knees that night&mdash;business
with the Mother of God that would take all
night long&mdash;and many, many other sleepless
nights; and many candles.<pb n='350'/><anchor id='Pg350'/></p>

<p>She put her left arm around Smith's neck
and hid her tear-wet face on his shoulder.
And, as he bore her out of the high tower
and descended the unlighted, interminable
stairs of stone, he heard her weeping against
his breast and softly asking intercession in
behalf of a dead young man who had tried
to be to her a "Kamerad"&mdash;as he understood
it&mdash;including the entire gamut, from amorous
beast to fiend.</p>
<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 25%'/>
<p>There was a single candle lighted in the bar
of the White Doe. On the "zinc," side by side,
like birds on a rail, sat the two muleteers.
In each big, sunburnt fist was an empty glass;
their spurred feet dangled; they leaned forward
where they sat, hunched up over their
knees, heads slightly turned, as though intently
listening. A haze of cigarette smoke
dimmed the candle flame.</p>

<p>The drone of an a&euml;roplane high in the midnight
sky came to them at intervals. At last
the sound died away under the far stars.</p>

<p>By the smoky candle flame Kid Glenn un<pb n='351'/><anchor id='Pg351'/>folded
and once more read the letter that
kept them there:</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>&mdash;I ought to get to Sainte Lesse somewhere around midnight. Don't
say a word to Maryette.</p>

<lg rend='right'>
<l>Jack.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>Sticky Smith, reading over his shoulder,
slowly rolled another cigarette.</p>

<p>"When Jack comes," he drawled, "it's
a-goin' to he'p a lot. That Maryette girl's
plumb done in."</p>

<p>"Sure she's done in," nodded Kid Glenn.
"Wouldn't it do in anybody to shoot up a
young man an' then see him step off the top
of a skyscraper?"</p>

<p>Smith admitted that he himself had felt
"kind er squeamish." He added: "Gawd, how
he spread when he hit them flags! You
didn't look at him, did you, Kid?"</p>

<p>"Naw. Say, d'ya think Maryette has gone
to bed?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. When we left her up there in
her room, I turned and took a peek to see
she was comfy, but she was down onto both
knees before that china virgin on the niche
over her bed."<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/></p>

<p>"She oughter be in bed. You gotta sleep
off a thing like that, or you feel punk next
day," remarked Glenn, meditatively twirling
the last drops of eau-de-vie around in his
tumbler. Then he swallowed them and
smacked his lips. "She'll come around all
O.&nbsp;K. when she sees Jack," he added.</p>

<p>"Goin' to let him wake her up?"</p>

<p>"Can you see us stoppin' him? He'd kick
the pants off us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" motioned Smith; "there's a automobile!
By gum! It's stopped!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two muleteers set their glasses on the
bar, slid to the floor, and marched, clanking,
into the covered way that led to the street.
Smith undid the bolts. A young man stood
outside in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack Burley, you old son of a gun!"
drawled Glenn. "Gawd! You look fit for a
dead one!"</p>

<p>"We ain't told her!" whispered Smith.
"She an' us done in a Fritz this evening, an'
it sorter turned Maryette's stomach&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not that she ain't well," explained Glenn
hastily; "only a girl feels different. Stick<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>
an' me, we just took a few drinks, but Maryette,
soon as she got home, she just flopped
down on her knees and asked that china virgin
of hers to go easy on that there Fritz&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had conducted Burley to the bar; both
their arms were draped around his shoulders;
both talked to him at the same time.</p>

<p>"This here Fritz," began Glenn&mdash;but Burley
freed himself from their embrace.</p>

<p>"Where's Maryette?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Smith jerked a silent thumb toward the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"In bed?"</p>

<p>"Or prayin'."</p>

<p>Burley flushed, hesitated.</p>

<p>"G'wan up, anyway," said Glenn. "I reckon
it'll do her a heap o' good to lamp you, you
old son of a gun!"</p>

<p>Burley turned, went up the short flight of
stairs to her closed door. There was candle-light
shining through the transom. He
knocked with a trembling hand. There was
no answer. He knocked again; heard her
uncertain step; stepped back as her door
opened.</p>

<p>The girl, a drooping figure in her night
robe, stood listlessly on the threshold. Which
of the muleteers it was who had come to her
door she did not notice. She said:</p>

<p>"I am very tired. Death is a dreadful
thing. I can't put it from my mind. I am
trying to pray&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lifted her weary eyes and found herself
looking into the face of her own lover.
She turned very white, lovely eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is it thou, Djack?"</p>

<p>"C'est moi, ma ploo belle!"</p>

<p>She melted into his tightening arms with a
faint cry. Very high overhead, under the
lustrous stars, an a&euml;roplane droned its uncharted
way across a blood-soaked world.</p>

<head>BARBARIANS<lb/><lb/>
By ROBERT W. CHAMBERS</head>

<p>In this story Mr. Chambers deals
with the early years of the Great
War. Sickened by what seems to
them at that time indifference on the
part of the American Government, an
odd group of men meet on the decks
of a mule transport. They have been
drawn to this common rendezvous by
a desire to enter the war and purge
their souls in the fight for the freedom
of the world.</p>

<p>There are twelve in the group,
eight Americans, three Frenchmen,
and a Belgian, and prominent among
them is Jim Neeland, whose earlier
experiences Mr. Chambers has related
in the "Dark Star."</p>

<p>Barbarians records the adventures
of these men, not together, but singly
or in groups, along the whole western
battle front, from the Belgian coast
to the mountains of Alsace. It is
filled with unusual character sketches
of the lives of the men in the
Trenches, and of life in the little
towns just inside the lines of Battle.
Through it all there is great beauty
and wonderful sense of justice and
right that is indeed more precious
than peace.</p>

<p rend='i2'>A ranch story of Montana which centers around the fact that the leader of
the "Lightfoot Rustlers" and the likeable but devil-may-care brother of the hero
are one and the same. Cullum is a "big" western story writer.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>UNDER HANDICAP.</hi> By Jackson Gregory.</p>

<p rend='i2'>Here is a story which is a strong picture of the changing of a western desert
into a land of usefulness, by irrigation. The story has a pleasing romance, yet
exciting at times, with adventures of more than one kind. Every reader of
"The Outlaw" will want this book.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>THE TRIUMPH.</hi> By Will N. Harben.</p>

<p rend='i2'>Loyalty is the keynote of this story, loyalty of the hero to his patriotic duty,
loyalty of a daughter to her father, and loyalty of a lover to his sweetheart.
The followers, of Mr. Harben will enjoy another of his southern stories.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>PIP.</hi> By Ian Hay (Capt. Ian Hay Beith), Author of "The First
Hundred Thousand."</p>

<p rend='i2'>A story of English school boys, their pleasures and pains, their sports and escapades,
that might be called a modern "Tom Brown," but a Tom Brown brimming
with laughter and with the slang of the day.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>MISS MILLION'S MAID.</hi> By Berta Ruck.</p>

<p rend='i2'>Another ingenious Berta Ruck plot in which a high-spirited girl of twenty-three,
well-bred, but penniless, flies in the face of tradition, becoming a maid of a
newly-made heiress. So entangled grow the love affairs of mistress and maid
that the reader has a merry time with the author in steering the girls on the
road to happiness.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>ENOCH CRANE.</hi> By F. Hopkinson and F. Berkeley Smith.</p>

<p rend='i2'>A story of New York specially. The scene is Waverly Place, in one of the
characteristic old houses of that section. In this respect the story is very similar
to "Peter," Mr. Smith's most popular book.</p>

<p><hi rend='bold'>PARTNERS OF THE NIGHT.</hi> By Leroy Scott.</p>

<p rend='i2'>Although a detective story, it is one altogether different from those of the ordinary
detective story writer. It is a story of the plain-clothes men and criminals
of New York, with a splendid romance.</p>
